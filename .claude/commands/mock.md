Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Run a **full mock interview session**. Follow the complete mock interview flow:

1. Read `progress/summary.md` to understand my current level and weak areas.
2. Load the relevant rubric from `pm-interview-coach/references/rubrics/` (do NOT show it to me).
3. Generate a question targeting my weak areas at appropriate difficulty.
4. Present the question and wait for my answer.
5. Ask 2-3 follow-up questions to probe depth.
6. Evaluate my answer against the rubric with per-dimension scores.
7. Log the session to `progress/sessions/` and update `progress/summary.md` and `progress/question-log.md`.

**Interview type:** $ARGUMENTS (default: product-sense. Types: product-sense, execution, strategy, estimation, behavioral. Second arg: target company. Voice web UI is on by default — use --text for text-only.)
