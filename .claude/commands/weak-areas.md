Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Run a **targeted practice session** focused on my weakest areas.

1. Read `progress/summary.md` to identify my 2-3 weakest dimensions across all types.
2. For each weak area:
   - Explain why this dimension matters in real interviews
   - Teach the relevant framework from `pm-interview-coach/references/frameworks/`
   - Present a practice question targeting that specific weakness
   - After I answer, give focused feedback on just that dimension
3. Track improvement on these specific dimensions.
4. Update progress files after the session.
