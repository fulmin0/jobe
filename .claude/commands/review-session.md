Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

**Review a past mock interview session.**

1. If arguments say "latest" or are empty, find the most recent file in `progress/sessions/`.
2. Otherwise, look for a matching session file in `progress/sessions/`.
3. Walk through the session:
   - Recap the question and my approach
   - Revisit the scores and feedback
   - Discuss what I have learned since then
   - If applicable, do a quick re-test on the same topic to measure improvement
4. Compare scores with my overall trend from `progress/summary.md`.

**Session:** $ARGUMENTS (default to "latest". Can specify a filename or date.)
