Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Run a **quick answer evaluation**. I will provide a question and my answer, and you evaluate it.

1. Load the relevant rubric from `pm-interview-coach/references/rubrics/`.
2. If I haven't provided the question and answer yet, ask me for them.
3. Evaluate against each rubric dimension with a 1-5 score.
4. Provide: overall score, per-dimension breakdown, strengths, gaps, model answer outline, frameworks to review.
5. Log the evaluation to `progress/question-log.md`.

**Interview type:** $ARGUMENTS (if not specified, infer from the question content)
