Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

**Post-real-interview debrief.**

Help me debrief after a real PM interview.

1. Ask me to describe:
   - Which company and role
   - What questions were asked (as much as I remember)
   - How I felt about my answers
   - Any surprising or difficult moments
2. For each question I describe:
   - Identify the question type
   - Evaluate my described approach against the relevant rubric
   - Suggest what I could improve for next time
3. Create a debrief log in `progress/sessions/` tagged as "real-interview".
4. Update `progress/summary.md` with notes about real interview patterns.
5. Generate practice versions of the actual questions I faced for future sessions.
