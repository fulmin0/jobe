Read the PM interview coach skill at `pm-interview-coach/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Run a **quick daily drill** (~10 minutes).

1. Read `progress/summary.md` to pick the optimal question type (lowest recent scores or least recently practiced).
2. If a type is specified in arguments, use that instead.
3. Ask ONE question at appropriate difficulty.
4. After my answer, give a brief evaluation (3-4 bullet points, not a full rubric breakdown).
5. Assign an overall score and log it to `progress/question-log.md` and update `progress/summary.md`.
6. Give one specific improvement tip.

**Type:** $ARGUMENTS (default to "auto" — agent selects based on weak areas)
