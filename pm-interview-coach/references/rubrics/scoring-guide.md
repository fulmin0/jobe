# Universal Scoring Guide

## Scale Definition

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Significant Gaps | Unstructured response, misses most key aspects, would not pass |
| 2 | Below Expectations | Some structure but major omissions, unclear reasoning |
| 3 | Meets Expectations | Solid structure, covers key points, minor gaps |
| 4 | Above Expectations | Strong depth, creative insights, well-articulated |
| 5 | Exceptional | Interviewer-caliber, thorough, original, would strongly pass |

## Overall Score Calculation

- Average of all dimension scores, weighted by dimension weights
- A single dimension score of 1 caps the overall at 3.0 maximum (a critical gap prevents a strong overall rating)

## Passing Thresholds

| Score Range | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| Below 2.5 | Needs significant improvement |
| 2.5 - 3.0 | Borderline, risky at top companies |
| 3.0 - 3.5 | Likely pass at most companies |
| 3.5 - 4.0 | Strong pass |
| 4.0+ | Exceptional, top-tier candidate |
