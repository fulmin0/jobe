# Estimation Evaluation Rubric

Limited transcript coverage (market sizing appears within strategy videos, no dedicated estimation video). This rubric combines insights from market sizing examples in strategy videos with general PM interview best practices.

**Source videos:** `4RGlcs-_Ke0` (market sizing within market entry), `vpsUw1vP8w4` (overview mention)

### 1. Problem Decomposition (30%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Multiple decomposition approaches considered, picks the best one and cross-validates. Elegant breakdown that captures all key variables. |
| 4 | Logical breakdown into key components with clear explanation of each step. |
| 3 | Reasonable 3-5 component breakdown with logical structure. |
| 2 | Attempts breakdown but misses key components or uses wrong splits. |
| 1 | No breakdown. Guesses a final number directly. |

### 2. Assumptions Quality (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Well-calibrated assumptions with reasoning for each. Uses anchor data points. Sensitivity analysis on key assumptions — identifies which ones matter most. Example quality from videos: "7B devices → 3.5B smartphones → 1B purchased yearly → 50M at 5% share" (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`). |
| 4 | Reasonable assumptions, each with stated rationale. Uses real-world anchors. |
| 3 | Stated assumptions within an order of magnitude. Some rationale provided. |
| 2 | Unstated or poorly justified assumptions. |
| 1 | Wildly inaccurate assumptions or no assumptions stated. |

**Key signal from videos:** Even imperfect math is better than none — rough calculations show analytical thinking (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`).

### 3. Mathematical Execution (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Efficient calculation with clear intermediate results. Rounds appropriately at each step. Easy for interviewer to follow and audit. |
| 4 | Clean calculations, arrives at reasonable answer. |
| 3 | Correct math, easy to follow. |
| 2 | Some arithmetic errors or unnecessarily complex approach. |
| 1 | Gets lost in calculations. Major errors. |

### 4. Sanity Check (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Cross-validates using an alternative estimation approach. Multiple sanity checks from different angles. Adjusts if something seems off. |
| 4 | Multiple sanity checks using known reference points. |
| 3 | Compares to at least one known reference point or related fact. |
| 2 | Says "seems reasonable" without actually checking. |
| 1 | No validation of the final answer. |

### 5. Communication (10%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Clear narration of approach. Checks in with interviewer. Perfect pacing. |
| 4 | Engaging walkthrough with good structure. |
| 3 | Listener can follow the reasoning. |
| 2 | Understandable but disorganized. |
| 1 | Hard to follow. Jumps between steps. |

## Common Mistakes

- Guessing a number without showing work
- Not stating assumptions explicitly
- Over-complicating with unnecessary precision (rounding is fine)
- Not sanity-checking the final answer against known facts
- Being afraid to do rough math during the interview

## Follow-up Probes

- "Your estimate is X. How confident are you? What range would you give?"
- "What if [key assumption] was off by 2x? How would that change your answer?"
- "Can you verify this using a completely different approach?"
- "How would this number change in [different market/country]?"
- "What additional data would most improve the accuracy of this estimate?"
