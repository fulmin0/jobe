**Source videos:** `RpAgs1z4K_0`, `um3SiBM82do`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market Understanding | 15% |
| Strategic Thinking | 35% |
| Business Model Reasoning | 20% |
| Risk Assessment | 10% |
| Actionability | 20% |

Strategic Thinking is heavily weighted — this question tests CEO-level thinking above all.

### Scoring Scale

#### 1. Market Understanding (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Maps the company's full product portfolio (software, hardware, platform, innovation). Understands revenue breakdown (e.g., Google: 80% ads, 20% licensing/hardware). Identifies macro factors like tech constriction, privacy regulations, competitive threats. |
| 4 | Strong knowledge of company's products, competitors, and market position. Quantifies key metrics. |
| 3 | Reasonable understanding of company landscape. Identifies main products and competitors. |
| 2 | Surface-level company knowledge. Misses key product lines or competitors. |
| 1 | Little or no understanding of the company's business. |

#### 2. Strategic Thinking (35%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Breaks down company mission into key themes to anchor product vision (`um3SiBM82do`). Narrows the ambiguous question by selecting a specific goal (diversify revenue / fight competition / grow users / innovate) and defends it with criteria: urgency + impact on long-term growth. Uses current business context (layoffs, market conditions) to inform prioritization. Proposes product **suites**, not features, for "5 years out" questions. |
| 4 | Clear goal selection with strong defense. Good use of current context. Thinks in product suites. |
| 3 | Selects a direction with reasonable logic but defense is thin. May propose features instead of suites. |
| 2 | Doesn't narrow the question. Tries to address everything or picks a direction without justification. |
| 1 | No strategic framing. Jumps to random product ideas without anchoring in company goals. |

**Key signal from videos:** "This question is really ambiguous — you MUST narrow it down by asking 'for what purpose?'" (`um3SiBM82do`). "Think about challenges that are big and lofty versus small pain points" (`um3SiBM82do`).

#### 3. Business Model Reasoning (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Identifies revenue concentration risks (e.g., 80% ads dependency). Proposes diversification with ROI analysis. Considers which user segments offer highest revenue potential vs. acquisition cost. |
| 4 | Strong revenue reasoning with consideration of acquisition costs and segment economics. |
| 3 | Discusses revenue model but analysis is surface-level. |
| 2 | Mentions revenue without depth. |
| 1 | No business model consideration. |

#### 4. Risk Assessment (10%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Acknowledges what could go wrong with the strategy. Considers competitive responses, regulatory risks. |
| 4 | Identifies key risks with mitigation. |
| 3 | Mentions 1-2 risks. |
| 2 | Ignores risks. |
| 1 | Presents only the upside. |

#### 5. Actionability (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Proposes ambitious, meaty solutions with concrete implementation paths. Mix of practical and moonshot ideas. Vision statement that "inspires the team" and "transcends more than just your product" (`zR2A14v5Awg`). Month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter roadmap. |
| 4 | Concrete solutions with phased approach. Clear vision. |
| 3 | Reasonable solutions but lacking phased execution plan. |
| 2 | Abstract ideas without implementation path. |
| 1 | No concrete proposals. |

### Common Mistakes (Roadmap/Vision)

- Not narrowing the ambiguous question by selecting a specific goal (`um3SiBM82do`)
- Over-rotating on trendy technologies (ChatGPT, AI) without specific use cases solving real challenges (`um3SiBM82do`)
- Thinking in terms of features rather than product suites for "5 year" questions (`um3SiBM82do`)
- Not using company mission to anchor product vision (`um3SiBM82do`)
- Ignoring current business context (layoffs, market conditions) when prioritizing goals (`um3SiBM82do`)
- Talking about small pain points instead of big challenges (`um3SiBM82do`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "Why this goal over the other three you mentioned?"
- "How does this connect back to [Company X]'s mission?"
- "What would make you abandon this strategy?"
- "How would you convince the CEO to invest in this direction?"
- "What does success look like in Year 1 vs. Year 5?"

## Subtype 2: Market Entry

**Question patterns:** "Should Amazon enter the smartphone market?," "Should [Company X] enter [Market Y]?"
**Source videos:** `4RGlcs-_Ke0`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market Understanding | 25% |
| Strategic Thinking | 20% |
| Business Model Reasoning | 25% |
| Risk Assessment | 20% |
| Actionability | 10% |

Market Understanding and Business Model are heavily weighted — market sizing and cost analysis are essential.

### Scoring Scale

#### 1. Market Understanding (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Quantifies market with rough calculations (even imperfect math is better than none). E.g., "7B devices → 3.5B smartphones → 1B purchased yearly → 50M at 5% share → $10B profit at $200 margin" (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`). Analyzes growth trajectory, competitors, customer loyalty/switching costs, and macro factors like supplier concentration. |
| 4 | Market sizing with reasonable math. Good competitive analysis including switching costs. |
| 3 | Market size discussed qualitatively. Basic competitive landscape. |
| 2 | No market sizing. Vague sense of "it's a big market." |
| 1 | No market analysis at all. |

#### 2. Strategic Thinking (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Starts by identifying why the company would want to enter this market (motivations). Assesses company strengths: distribution, economies of scale, brand, patents, product advantages. Uses decision tree approach: "Yes if X, No if Y" rather than forcing a single answer (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`). |
| 4 | Clear motivation analysis and strength assessment. Decision is nuanced. |
| 3 | Identifies some motivations and strengths. Decision is reasonable but binary. |
| 2 | Thin motivation analysis. Decision lacks nuance. |
| 1 | Jumps to yes/no without analysis. |

**Key signal from videos:** "I like this method [decision tree] because it doesn't put so much pressure on having to pick one way or the other" (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`).

#### 3. Business Model Reasoning (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Calculates cost to enter: hardware/manufacturing + people resources + timeline. Considers break-even timeline, not just profit margins. Evaluates profit margins with specificity (e.g., "smartphone margins: 20% low end, 60-70% Apple high end," `4RGlcs-_Ke0`). |
| 4 | Cost analysis with reasonable estimates. Break-even considered. |
| 3 | Mentions costs but doesn't calculate. Understands margins broadly. |
| 2 | No cost analysis. Just revenue upside. |
| 1 | No financial reasoning. |

#### 4. Risk Assessment (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Assesses customer loyalty and brand switching costs. Identifies that "people rarely switch unless the features are differentiated, are super special" (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`). Considers macro risks (supplier concentration, regulatory). Evaluates cannibalization of existing products. |
| 4 | Strong risk identification with switching cost analysis. |
| 3 | Identifies 2-3 key risks with some analysis. |
| 2 | Acknowledges risks exist but no analysis. |
| 1 | Ignores risks entirely. |

#### 5. Actionability (10%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Evaluates three entry methods: build yourself, partner/outsource, or acquire a company (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`). Recommends one with reasoning. |
| 4 | Considers at least two entry methods. |
| 3 | Suggests how to enter but only one approach. |
| 2 | Vague on implementation. |
| 1 | No entry method discussion. |

### Common Mistakes (Market Entry)

- Forcing a definitive yes/no instead of using decision tree logic (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`)
- Not quantifying market size with rough calculations (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`)
- Forgetting to assess customer loyalty and switching costs (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`)
- Not considering the break-even timeline (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`)
- Not evaluating different entry methods (build vs. partner vs. acquire) (`4RGlcs-_Ke0`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "What data would change your recommendation?"
- "What would [Company X]'s competitive advantage be in this market?"
- "How long until this investment pays off?"
- "What would the incumbent [Competitor] do in response?"

## Subtype 3: Go-to-Market / Launch

**Question patterns:** "How would you launch this product?," "What's your go-to-market strategy for X?"
**Source videos:** `KYkT7I2wZh8`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market Understanding | 20% |
| Strategic Thinking | 25% |
| Business Model Reasoning | 15% |
| Risk Assessment | 10% |
| Actionability | 30% |

Actionability is heavily weighted — this is fundamentally an execution question.

### Scoring Scale

#### 2. Strategic Thinking (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses 5-step GTM framework: Success Metrics → Who → What (messaging) → Where (channels) → When (timing) (`KYkT7I2wZh8`). Starts with end goal and works backwards through conversion funnel. Defines target users with physical, observable attributes (not motivations) for easier targeting. Crafts brand positioning around 1-2 specific adjectives. |
| 4 | Covers all 5 steps with clear logic. Good backward funnel reasoning. |
| 3 | Covers most steps. May default to generic channels without strategic selection. |
| 2 | Random marketing ideas without a framework. |
| 1 | No strategic approach to launch. |

**Key signal from videos:** "A lot of marketing people default to 'oh let's go execute on Facebook ads and Google search.' But... is it often that drivers are on Google search? Not necessarily" (`KYkT7I2wZh8`).

#### 5. Actionability (30%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Channel selection based on where users physically are, where they get content, and who influences them (`KYkT7I2wZh8`). Considers seasonality, time of day, and life occasions. Balances personalization (drives engagement) with scale (drives reach). Prioritizes channels by acquisition cost vs. conversion volume. |
| 4 | Creative channel selection with targeting rationale. Good balance of approaches. |
| 3 | Reasonable channel selection but defaults to obvious options. |
| 2 | Generic "Facebook ads and Google search" without strategic reasoning. |
| 1 | No concrete channel or timing plan. |

### Common Mistakes (GTM)

- Starting with generic channels (Facebook ads, Google search) without strategic reasoning (`KYkT7I2wZh8`)
- Defaulting to motivation-based segments that are hard to target (`KYkT7I2wZh8`)
- Trying to be known for too many things instead of focusing on 1-2 key differentiators (`KYkT7I2wZh8`)
- Not considering the tradeoff between personalization and scale (`KYkT7I2wZh8`)
- Forgetting timing — "deliver your message at the right time, at the right place" (`KYkT7I2wZh8`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "How would you measure success in the first 90 days?"
- "What's your cost per acquisition target?"
- "How would you adjust this strategy for a different market/geography?"
- "What channels would you deprioritize and why?"

## Subtype 4: Monetization

**Question patterns:** "How would you monetize WhatsApp?," "What business model would you use for X?"
**Source videos:** `xJVx06LQXww`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market Understanding | 15% |
| Strategic Thinking | 20% |
| Business Model Reasoning | 35% |
| Risk Assessment | 15% |
| Actionability | 15% |

Business Model Reasoning is dominant — this is fundamentally a monetization question.

### Scoring Scale

#### 3. Business Model Reasoning (35%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Knows the six common monetization models: subscription, freemium, ads, transaction fees, selling goods/services, licensing (`xJVx06LQXww`). Selects models that fit the product's characteristics and user base. Understands why some models don't work for specific products (e.g., messaging apps are commoditized — users won't pay, intimate — hard to inject ads). Proposes mix-and-match approach for revenue diversification. Draws inspiration from international products like WeChat. |
| 4 | Covers relevant monetization models with strong fit analysis. Multiple revenue streams. |
| 3 | Identifies 2-3 applicable models with reasonable fit analysis. |
| 2 | Proposes one model without considering alternatives or fit. |
| 1 | No monetization model knowledge. Guesses. |

**Key signal from videos:** "Most successful businesses mix and match multiple monetization models to diversify revenue streams" (`xJVx06LQXww`). "Check out Chinese products like WeChat — they've come up with different ways to monetize" (`xJVx06LQXww`).

#### 4. Risk Assessment (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Considers user alienation risk — "designing experiences that won't isolate your users" (`xJVx06LQXww`). Balances business revenue goals with user satisfaction. Evaluates competitive risk of monetization pushing users to alternatives. |
| 4 | Considers user experience impact of monetization. |
| 3 | Mentions risk briefly. |
| 2 | No consideration of user impact. |
| 1 | Proposes monetization that would clearly alienate users. |

### Common Mistakes (Monetization)

- Designing monetization that isolates users rather than enhances their experience (`xJVx06LQXww`)
- Copying monetization models without adapting to the specific product (`xJVx06LQXww`)
- Not considering how models can work together (`xJVx06LQXww`)
- Not understanding why certain products are hard to monetize (commoditization, intimacy) (`xJVx06LQXww`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "Which model would you start with and why?"
- "How would you test pricing before committing?"
- "What's the risk this monetization pushes users to a competitor?"
- "How would you measure revenue per user across different models?"

## Subtype 5: Growth

**Question patterns:** "How would you grow [Product X]?," "How do you achieve product-market fit and scale?"
**Source videos:** `AQWUOY_zsWM`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Market Understanding | 15% |
| Strategic Thinking | 25% |
| Business Model Reasoning | 15% |
| Risk Assessment | 15% |
| Actionability | 30% |

Actionability is heavily weighted — this is about concrete, testable tactics.

### Scoring Scale

#### 2. Strategic Thinking (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Insists on product-market fit BEFORE growth investment. Knows how to measure PMF: qualitative (survey: "how sad would you be without this product?") and quantitative (retention curve >30% after 1 year) (`AQWUOY_zsWM`). Understands growth is a game of compounding 1% improvements. Balances short-term wins with long-term brand health — "don't sacrifice long-term success for short-term wins" (`AQWUOY_zsWM`). |
| 4 | Strong PMF awareness. Good balance of short/long term. Understands compounding. |
| 3 | Mentions PMF importance. Reasonable growth strategy. |
| 2 | Jumps to growth tactics without PMF consideration. |
| 1 | No strategic framing for growth. Random ideas. |

#### 5. Actionability (30%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Knows 8 growth tactics across 3 categories (`AQWUOY_zsWM`): **Conversion** (shorten funnel, smart defaults, save progress), **Targeting** (behavioral > demographic, right placement, right time), **Content/Visuals** (test urgency/personalization, leverage visuals). Applies specific tactics with real examples (TikTok showing content before signup, Airbnb sending photographers). Proposes experiments to validate. |
| 4 | Covers tactics across categories with specific applications. |
| 3 | Identifies reasonable growth tactics but limited to 1-2 categories. |
| 2 | Generic growth ideas (more ads, social media). |
| 1 | No concrete growth tactics. |

### Common Mistakes (Growth)

- Starting growth efforts before achieving product-market fit (`AQWUOY_zsWM`)
- Dismissing 1% improvements as insignificant — they compound (`AQWUOY_zsWM`)
- Spamming users for short-term engagement, damaging long-term perception (`AQWUOY_zsWM`)
- Using demographic targeting when behavioral targeting is more effective (`AQWUOY_zsWM`)
- Adding unnecessary steps in user funnels (`AQWUOY_zsWM`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "How would you know you've achieved product-market fit?"
- "Which growth lever has the highest ROI for this product?"
- "How would you run an experiment to test this tactic?"
- "What's the risk of over-optimizing for this metric?"
