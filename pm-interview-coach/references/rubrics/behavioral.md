## Follow-up Probe Suggestions

- "What would you do differently if you faced this situation again?"
- "How did the other stakeholders react? How did you handle disagreement?"
- "What was the most difficult decision you had to make in this situation?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of how you influenced [person/team]?"
- "What did you learn from this experience that you've applied since?"
- "Tell me about a time this approach didn't work. What did you do?"
