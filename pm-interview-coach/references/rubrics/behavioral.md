# Behavioral Evaluation Rubric

Limited transcript coverage (1-2 videos touch on behavioral elements, primarily through the "favorite product" question type). This rubric combines insights from transcript content with general PM interview best practices.

**Source videos:** `TsYpCng2Pfg` (favorite product storytelling), `k4wtOqReb3A` (favorite product framework), `vpsUw1vP8w4` (overview)

### 1. Story Selection (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | High-impact, recent story that uniquely demonstrates the competency. For product-related behavioral questions, picks a product you genuinely use and love — "pick a product you've actively told friends about" (`vpsUw1vP8w4`). Authenticity is visible. |
| 4 | Strong story with high stakes and clear demonstration of the skill. |
| 3 | Relevant story with reasonable complexity. |
| 2 | Loosely related story, low stakes. |
| 1 | Irrelevant story that doesn't address the competency. |

**Key signal from videos:** "Choose a product you genuinely use and love — authenticity shows through" (`TsYpCng2Pfg`). "Pick a product that you personally love. But one that isn't too complex... and not a product that's so commonly used that the interviewer might have heard the same answer five times" (`k4wtOqReb3A`).

### 2. Structure (STAR) (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Natural storytelling that follows STAR without feeling mechanical. Appropriate proportions (~10% S, 10% T, 60% A, 20% R). Smooth transitions. |
| 4 | Tight STAR with each section adding value. |
| 3 | Clear STAR structure with appropriate proportions. |
| 2 | Some structure but unbalanced (too much situation, too little action). |
| 1 | No structure. Rambling narrative. |

### 3. Personal Contribution (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Shows leadership through personal initiative, influence on others, and driving outcomes. Deep detail on personal thought process and decision-making. Uses "I" for specific contributions. |
| 4 | Clear personal actions with thought process explanation. |
| 3 | Clear personal actions and decisions using "I" appropriately. |
| 2 | Mentions personal role but vague ("I helped with..."). |
| 1 | Uses "we" throughout with no clarity on personal role. |

### 4. Impact and Results (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Quantified results with business impact across multiple dimensions (team, business, customer, process). Both immediate and longer-term outcomes. |
| 4 | Impressive results with clear business impact. |
| 3 | Specific, quantified results connected to personal actions. |
| 2 | Vague results ("it went well"). |
| 1 | No results mentioned. Story trails off. |

### 5. Self-Awareness and Growth (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Deep self-awareness connecting learning to personal growth trajectory and leadership philosophy. Evidence of behavioral change in subsequent situations. |
| 4 | Insightful lessons with evidence of applied learning. |
| 3 | Genuine reflection on what went well and what could improve. |
| 2 | Token "what I learned" that feels rehearsed. |
| 1 | No reflection. Presents everything as perfect. |

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing a product/story you don't authentically care about (`TsYpCng2Pfg`)
- Ranting about features without structure (`vpsUw1vP8w4`)
- Not explaining the strategic viewpoint — interviewers want to see strategic thinking even in behavioral questions (`vpsUw1vP8w4`)
- For product behavioral questions: listing features you wish existed rather than thinking about users and their pain points (`vpsUw1vP8w4`)

## Follow-up Probes

- "What would you do differently if you faced this situation again?"
- "How did the other stakeholders react? How did you handle disagreement?"
- "What was the most difficult decision you had to make in this situation?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of how you influenced [person/team]?"
- "What did you learn from this experience that you've applied since?"
- "Tell me about a time this approach didn't work. What did you do?"
