### Scoring Scale

#### 1. Structure & Framework (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | States 4-part framework upfront (Why → Users → Pain Points → Solutions), transitions feel natural not formulaic. Completes answer in ~30 min of talking time with proper allocation: 5 min why, 5 min segments, 10 min pain points, 7 min solutions (`aDRVDvxnDR8`). |
| 4 | Clear framework stated and followed. Good signposting ("Now I'll move to pain points"). Smooth transitions, adapts based on interviewer signals. |
| 3 | Uses a framework consistently. Covers all sections but may spend too long on one area or rush another. |
| 2 | Attempts structure but loses it midway. Jumps between sections or forgets to address one entirely. |
| 1 | No framework. Random thoughts, jumps straight to solutions, or rambles without direction. |

#### 2. Strategic Thinking / Why (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Treats the "why" section like an investor pitch (`KruFg7-9qBM`). Covers trends, existing ecosystem players, TAM quantification, mission alignment with specifics (not generic "connecting people"), company strengths AND weaknesses in this space. Makes honest assessment of whether to build for the interviewing company (`EOwkN1gQfsk`). |
| 4 | Strong trend analysis, identifies market gaps, specific mission alignment. Acknowledges existing players and positions differentiation. |
| 3 | Covers why the space matters and basic mission alignment. May miss existing ecosystem players or give generic mission connection. |
| 2 | Thin "why" section — "it's a big market" without quantification. Generic mission alignment that could apply to any product. |
| 1 | Skips the "why" entirely and jumps to users or solutions. No strategic framing. |

**Key signal from videos:** "Most candidates rush through one of the most important parts... Think about it as pitching to the CEO of the company." (`X5Wv8S3Jxlc`, `KruFg7-9qBM`)

#### 3. User Empathy (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses Three Spheres of Empathy (`KruFg7-9qBM`): personal experience, friends/family/media, and visualization. Segments by behavior not demographics. Concrete day-in-the-life user journey with granular steps. Pain points feel like a genuine rant — "you're getting so entrenched into the user shoes that you're complaining as if you were one of the users" (`aDRVDvxnDR8`). Emotional connection visible. Includes existing solutions in journey mapping (`18vWpDiL75Q`). |
| 4 | Strong behavioral segmentation with MECE groups. Detailed user journey from personal experience. Pain points are specific and emotionally resonant. Identifies both frustrating AND suboptimal/inefficient experiences. |
| 3 | Identifies 2-3 segments with some behavioral basis. Reasonable pain points but may lack emotional depth or specificity. User journey exists but is high-level. |
| 2 | Demographic segmentation (age groups, income levels). Pain points are needs rather than frustrations. Hypothetical scenarios instead of concrete experiences. |
| 1 | No segmentation — designs for "all users." Pain points are vague or absent. No user journey. |

**Key signal from videos:** "Segmenting by behavior is better than demographics" (`ArgWgjasRqQ`). "Break down and get as specific as you can. Because the more specific you get, the more you can empathize" (`18vWpDiL75Q`).

#### 4. Prioritization (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses objective scoring matrix at every decision point — segments, pain points, and solutions. Criteria borrowed from VC thinking: TAM, frequency, underserved population, spend (`ArgWgjasRqQ`). Scores are relative and explained. Open to being proven wrong during discussion (`PU635pDoxy4`). |
| 4 | Objective criteria stated before choosing. Clear rationale for each prioritization. Uses 2-3 criteria consistently. |
| 3 | States reasons for choices but criteria may be implicit rather than explicit. Some prioritization feels subjective. |
| 2 | Makes choices without clear criteria. "I think X is more important" without explaining why. |
| 1 | No prioritization — lists everything without choosing. Or picks arbitrarily. |

**Key signal from videos:** "What would help is a more objective criteria" (`JJfLOSRY1hk`). Pain point prioritization criteria: # people affected, severity, existing solutions (`18vWpDiL75Q`).

#### 5. Solution Creativity (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Problem-led solutions (not solution-led). Proposes 3-5 solutions where the last 2 differentiate from competition (`aDRVDvxnDR8`). Applies technologies/trends to novel use cases (`kKNvHDRXgAc`). Borrows from other verticals. Solutions have UX specificity — describes the actual user experience, not just features. Acknowledges existing solutions and builds beyond them. Mix of practical MVP and ambitious moonshot ideas (`PU635pDoxy4`). |
| 4 | 3+ creative solutions with clear differentiation from existing products. Good technology/trend application. Solutions feel feasible and tied to the pain points. |
| 3 | 3 reasonable solutions with trade-off evaluation. Picks one with justification. Some solutions may already exist. |
| 2 | 1-2 surface-level ideas. May propose something that already exists (e.g., "build a directory" when ZocDoc exists). Generic feature proposals. |
| 1 | Single vague idea with no feasibility reasoning. Solution disconnected from identified pain points. |

**Key signal from videos:** "The best way to avoid falling into this trap is just avoiding generic pain points entirely" (`kKNvHDRXgAc`). "Your first 1-3 solutions are the most common... the last couple help you peel away from your competition" (`aDRVDvxnDR8`).

#### 6. Communication (10%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Takes 1-2 minutes to think before speaking, then delivers concisely. Drives the conversation without interviewer prompting. Uses energy and enthusiasm when discussing pain points and solutions. Checks in with interviewer at transitions. |
| 4 | Concise and clear. Good pacing with natural transitions. Rarely needs prompting. |
| 3 | Generally clear but may ramble in spots. Follows prompts well but doesn't always drive independently. |
| 2 | Disorganized. Thinks out loud in a way that's hard to follow. Requires significant prompting. |
| 1 | Rambling, hard to follow. Goes on tangents. Reads off notes mechanically. |

### Common Mistakes (New Product)

- Asking generic clarifying questions that don't influence the answer: "Is this mobile or desktop?" (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)
- Assuming you should build for the interviewing company without assessing fit (`EOwkN1gQfsk`)
- Generic mission alignment: "connecting supply side and demand side" applied to any company (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)
- Demographic segmentation when behavioral would reveal better pain points (`ArgWgjasRqQ`)
- Identifying needs instead of specific pain points — "desire to reach people" vs. "I struggle to advertise" (`PU635pDoxy4`)
- Coming up with only 1-2 solutions instead of 3-5 (`aDRVDvxnDR8`)
- Proposing solutions that already exist without acknowledging them (`kKNvHDRXgAc`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "Why should [Company X] build this instead of a startup?" (`EOwkN1gQfsk`)
- "How would you validate this opportunity before investing in it?"
- "Walk me through the day-in-the-life of your target user" (`KruFg7-9qBM`)
- "What's the biggest risk with your recommendation?"
- "How does this fit into the company's broader product strategy?"
- "What if [constraint]? How would that change your approach?"

## Subtype 2: Improve an Existing Product

**Question patterns:** "How would you improve X?," "What's your favorite product and how would you improve it?"
**Source videos:** `TsYpCng2Pfg`, `k4wtOqReb3A`, `vpsUw1vP8w4`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Structure & Framework | 10% |
| Strategic Thinking / Why | 25% |
| User Empathy | 25% |
| Prioritization | 15% |
| Solution Creativity | 15% |
| Communication | 10% |

Strategic Thinking is weighted higher here because understanding the company's business model, goals, and competitive landscape is essential to proposing improvements that matter.

### Scoring Scale

#### 1. Structure & Framework (10%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses 4-part favorite product framework naturally: Motivation → Users & Value → Why It's My Favorite → Improvements (`TsYpCng2Pfg`). Smooth flow that tells a compelling story. |
| 4 | Clear framework with all sections covered. Good transitions. |
| 3 | Follows a reasonable structure. May rush some sections. |
| 2 | Loose structure. Lists features without organizing thinking. |
| 1 | Rants about features without structure. No clear framework. |

#### 2. Strategic Thinking / Why (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Explains the problem space the product solves, not just what it does. Identifies business model, revenue streams, supply/demand dynamics. Shows how specific design choices drive business goals (e.g., Too Good To Go's odd hours protect full-price revenue, `TsYpCng2Pfg`). Improvement suggestions align with company's strategic priorities and competitive position (`k4wtOqReb3A`). |
| 4 | Strong understanding of business model and competitive landscape. Improvements tied to business metrics. |
| 3 | Describes what the product does and basic business model. Improvements are reasonable but loosely tied to strategy. |
| 2 | Focuses on personal feature preferences without business reasoning. "I wish it had X." |
| 1 | Rants about features with no strategic perspective. No mention of business goals or competitive context. |

**Key signal from videos:** "Most people will use this part to just rattle off cool features... that is not what you want to do" (`k4wtOqReb3A`). "Identify the company's key top goals and media opportunities that will help the business grow" (`k4wtOqReb3A`).

#### 3. User Empathy (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Identifies distinct user types in the ecosystem (multi-sided if applicable). Shows genuine passion through concrete personal usage stories. Pain points consider both early users (trust, ambiguity) and ongoing users (convenience, limitations) (`TsYpCng2Pfg`). |
| 4 | Strong understanding of different user types. Authentic personal experience. Specific pain points that are generalizable. |
| 3 | Identifies main user types. Reasonable pain points from personal experience. |
| 2 | Mentions users generically. Pain points are personal wishes not generalizable. |
| 1 | No user identification. Just lists features. |

#### 4. Prioritization (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Prioritizes improvements by impact on core business metrics (orders, revenue, engagement). Connects each improvement to measurable outcomes. |
| 4 | Clear criteria for why proposed improvements matter more than alternatives. |
| 3 | Some reasoning for improvement priorities. Connection to metrics exists but is loose. |
| 2 | Lists many improvements without prioritizing. |
| 1 | No prioritization. Random list of wishes. |

#### 5. Solution Creativity (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Proposes improvements that represent strategic shifts, not just feature additions. E.g., transforming Yelp "from a search-led platform to an exploration-discovery platform" (`k4wtOqReb3A`). Solutions leverage the company's unique strengths. |
| 4 | Creative improvements that go beyond obvious feature requests. Shows awareness of competitive threats. |
| 3 | Reasonable improvements with clear value proposition. |
| 2 | Generic improvements anyone could suggest. Not differentiated from obvious ideas. |
| 1 | Improvements that don't solve real pain points or already exist. |

#### 6. Communication (10%)

Same scale as Subtype 1.

### Common Mistakes (Improve Product)

- Choosing a product you don't actually use regularly — lack of authenticity shows (`TsYpCng2Pfg`)
- Not explaining the problem space, especially for lesser-known products (`TsYpCng2Pfg`)
- Rattling off personal feature requests without connecting to company goals (`k4wtOqReb3A`)
- Picking products too complex to explain or too common (everyone picks the same one) (`k4wtOqReb3A`)
- Listing features you wish existed rather than thinking about target users and their generalizable pain points (`vpsUw1vP8w4`)
- Not thinking this question is important and failing to prepare (`k4wtOqReb3A`)

### Follow-up Probes

- "How would this improvement affect [Company X]'s revenue?"
- "What's your top priority improvement and why?"
- "How would competitors respond to this change?"
- "What metrics would you track to know if this improvement worked?"
- "How does this compare to what [Competitor Y] does?"

## Subtype 3: Fix a Problem / Worst Experience

**Question patterns:** "How would you fix Airbnb's worst post-booking experience?," "What's the worst part of using X?"
**Source videos:** `dz-hqOih9qY`, `vpsUw1vP8w4`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Structure & Framework | 10% |
| Strategic Thinking / Why | 15% |
| User Empathy | 30% |
| Prioritization | 20% |
| Solution Creativity | 15% |
| Communication | 10% |

User Empathy and Prioritization are weighted highest because the core challenge is identifying severity and choosing the right problem to fix.

### Scoring Scale

#### 1. Structure & Framework (10%)

Same scale as Subtype 1 but adapted: Metrics → Users → Pain Points (exhaustive) → Prioritize by severity → Solutions (preventative + reactive).

#### 2. Strategic Thinking / Why (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Chooses metrics that capture value for all sides of the marketplace. E.g., "number of nights booked and stayed" captures host, guest, and platform value simultaneously (`dz-hqOih9qY`). Explicitly rejects metrics that don't fit (e.g., retention for infrequent-use products). |
| 4 | Selects relevant primary metric with clear reasoning. Understands marketplace dynamics. |
| 3 | Identifies a reasonable metric but doesn't fully justify the choice. |
| 2 | Picks generic metrics (DAU, revenue) without specificity to the product. |
| 1 | No metric framing. Jumps to pain points without anchoring. |

#### 3. User Empathy (30%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Maps exhaustive pain points for BOTH sides of marketplace (guests AND hosts, `dz-hqOih9qY`). Uses personal anecdotes that make pain viscerally real. Identifies severity levels for each pain point. Distinguishes between "you have a place but something doesn't work" vs. "you don't have a place at all." |
| 4 | Comprehensive pain point list with personal experience. Clear severity assessment. Considers both marketplace sides. |
| 3 | Good set of pain points with some personal experience. Severity is discussed but not rigorously compared. |
| 2 | Surface-level pain points. No personal experience. Only considers one side of marketplace. |
| 1 | Vague or few pain points. No empathy or emotional connection to user frustrations. |

#### 4. Prioritization (20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses criteria adapted to the question: for "worst experience," weights pain level and impact on metrics MORE than frequency. Explicitly states: "I would weight frequency less for 'worst experience' — even 1% of users is still a large user group" (`dz-hqOih9qY`). |
| 4 | Clear criteria with appropriate weighting for the question type. |
| 3 | Uses criteria but doesn't adapt weighting to the "worst experience" framing. |
| 2 | Picks the most obvious problem without systematic comparison. |
| 1 | No prioritization logic. |

#### 5. Solution Creativity (15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Develops two-pronged approach: preventative solutions (reduce occurrence) AND reactive solutions (handle when it happens anyway) (`dz-hqOih9qY`). "You can't make everything perfect, but if you make up for it, users can still be happy." Mix of ML-powered detection, process improvements, and creative recovery options. |
| 4 | Both preventative and reactive solutions. Good use of technology. |
| 3 | Reasonable solutions but only one approach (prevention OR recovery). |
| 2 | Single solution without depth. |
| 1 | Solution doesn't address the identified problem. |

### Common Mistakes (Fix a Problem)

- Choosing retention as a metric for infrequent-use products without acknowledging measurement challenges (`dz-hqOih9qY`)
- Not considering both sides of a marketplace (`dz-hqOih9qY`)
- Weighing frequency equally for "worst experience" questions — should weight pain/impact more (`dz-hqOih9qY`)
- Only proposing preventative solutions without recovery paths

### Follow-up Probes

- "What data would you need to validate this is actually the worst experience?"
- "How would you measure the impact of your fix?"
- "What happens when your prevention fails — what's the fallback?"
- "How would you prioritize this against other engineering work?"

## Subtype 4: Unfamiliar / Niche Spaces

**Question patterns:** "Build a product to help people buy antiques," "Design for a space you have no personal experience with"
**Source videos:** `EOwkN1gQfsk`, `KruFg7-9qBM`

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Structure & Framework | 15% |
| Strategic Thinking / Why | 25% |
| User Empathy | 25% |
| Prioritization | 10% |
| Solution Creativity | 15% |
| Communication | 10% |

Strategic Thinking is weighted higher because honestly assessing mission alignment (potentially recommending NOT to build) is the differentiating skill here.

### Scoring Scale

#### 2. Strategic Thinking / Why (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Honestly assesses whether the product fits the interviewing company's ecosystem. Willing to recommend "do not build for [Company X]" if it doesn't align (`EOwkN1gQfsk`). Evaluates: trends supporting the space, market size (niche vs. mass market), alignment strength to mission, company strengths applicable, business benefit (engagement, revenue, new users). |
| 4 | Thorough mission alignment assessment. Acknowledges weaknesses honestly. |
| 3 | Assesses fit but may force-fit when it doesn't align well. |
| 2 | Surface-level "yes it fits because connecting people." |
| 1 | No mission assessment. Assumes build for the company. |

**Key signal from videos:** "I'm going to recommend that we do not build this for Facebook" (`EOwkN1gQfsk`). "Truthfully assessing does this fit within the Facebook product ecosystem and not just force fitting it" (`EOwkN1gQfsk`).

#### 3. User Empathy (25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Uses visualization sphere of empathy when personal experience is lacking. "I have never bought an antique... but I'm going to imagine myself as someone who needed to go hunt down a vase from the Ming Dynasty" (`EOwkN1gQfsk`). Develops strong pain points through logical user journey mapping despite unfamiliarity. |
| 4 | Good use of visualization. Develops reasonable pain points through imagination and logical reasoning. |
| 3 | Attempts to understand the space but pain points feel hypothetical and generic. |
| 2 | Intimidated by unfamiliarity. Shallow pain points. |
| 1 | Cannot develop empathy for unfamiliar space. Gives up or defaults to generic answers. |

All other dimensions use the same scale as Subtype 1.

### Common Mistakes (Niche Spaces)

- Force-fitting a product into a company's ecosystem when it doesn't align (`EOwkN1gQfsk`)
- Not clarifying broad or ambiguous scopes at the beginning (`EOwkN1gQfsk`)
- Being too intimidated by unfamiliar spaces to develop strong opinions (`EOwkN1gQfsk`)
- Only tackling one pain point when you could address multiple

### Follow-up Probes

- "You've never used this kind of product — how did you develop your understanding of user needs?"
- "What assumptions are you making that you'd want to validate?"
- "Does this really fit [Company X]'s mission? Convince me."
- "What would a competitor in this space think of your approach?"
