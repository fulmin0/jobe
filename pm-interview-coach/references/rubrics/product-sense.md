# Product Sense Evaluation Rubric

## Dimensions

### 1. Structure and Approach (Weight: 20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No framework, random thoughts, jumps between topics |
| 2 | Attempts structure but loses it midway, unclear transitions |
| 3 | Clear framework (e.g., CIRCLES), follows it consistently |
| 4 | Strong framework with smooth transitions, adapts naturally |
| 5 | Masterful structure that feels natural, not formulaic; adjusts based on discussion |

### 2. User Understanding (Weight: 25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No user segmentation, generic assumptions about "all users" |
| 2 | Mentions users superficially, no prioritization of segments |
| 3 | Identifies 2-3 segments, picks one with reasoning, understands core pain points |
| 4 | Deep empathy, creative segments, strong justification for focus, day-in-the-life thinking |
| 5 | Reveals non-obvious user insights, quantifies user impact, considers underserved segments |

### 3. Problem Definition (Weight: 15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Jumps straight to solutions without defining the problem |
| 2 | Restates the prompt without deeper analysis |
| 3 | Clarifies scope, identifies the core problem, asks good clarifying questions |
| 4 | Uncovers root causes, frames problem insightfully beyond the obvious |
| 5 | Reframes problem in a way that opens a better solution space |

### 4. Solution Quality (Weight: 25%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Single vague idea, not feasible or thought through |
| 2 | 1-2 ideas with surface-level reasoning |
| 3 | 3+ ideas, evaluates trade-offs, picks one with clear justification |
| 4 | Creative, feasible solutions with differentiation analysis and implementation awareness |
| 5 | Solutions show product intuition, considers edge cases, second-order effects, and ecosystem impact |

### 5. Metrics and Success (Weight: 15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No mention of how to measure success |
| 2 | Generic metrics (DAU, revenue) without specificity to the solution |
| 3 | Relevant primary and secondary metrics, basic success criteria |
| 4 | Metrics tied to user outcomes, includes counter-metrics and guardrail metrics |
| 5 | Comprehensive measurement plan with leading/lagging indicators, experimentation approach, and rollout strategy |

## Follow-up Probe Suggestions

- "How would you prioritize among your solutions?"
- "What is the biggest risk with your recommendation?"
- "How would you test this before a full launch?"
- "What would you do if [metric] dropped after launch?"
- "How does this fit into the company's broader product strategy?"
- "Walk me through the day-in-the-life of your target user."
