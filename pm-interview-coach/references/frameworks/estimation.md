## Market Sizing Approach
**Source:** `4RGlcs-_Ke0` — Product Strategy Interviews: Market Entry
**Use for:** Market sizing within strategy questions, back-of-envelope calculations

### Top-Down Filtering Method
Start from the largest relevant number and filter down through logical steps:

1. **Global/National Population** — Start with the broadest relevant base
2. **Filter by Access** — Who has the technology/infrastructure? (e.g., smartphone users)
3. **Filter by Need** — Who actually needs this? (e.g., annual purchasers)
4. **Apply Share** — What realistic market share could you capture?
5. **Calculate Revenue** — Units x price point = revenue estimate

### Worked Example (Smartphones)
```
World population:           7 billion
Smartphone users:           3.5 billion (50%)
Annual new purchases:       1 billion/year (~29% replacement rate)
Target market share:        5%
Units captured:             50 million
Revenue at $500 avg:        $25 billion
```

### Tips
- "Even imperfect math is better than none" — show the analytical process
- Round aggressively for mental math (use 7B not 7.9B)
- State assumptions explicitly at each step
- Sanity-check the final answer against something known

## Useful Reference Numbers

Keep these anchors in mind for estimates:

| Fact | Number |
|------|--------|
| US population | ~330 million |
| US households | ~130 million |
| US smartphone users | ~300 million |
| US GDP | ~$27 trillion |
| Average US household income | ~$75,000 |
| US life expectancy | ~78 years |
| Hours in a year | ~8,760 |
| Seconds in a day | ~86,400 |
| World population | ~8 billion |
| Global smartphone users | ~4.5 billion |
| Global internet users | ~5.5 billion |

## Estimation Principles

1. **Round aggressively**: Use 300M instead of 331M for US population. Precision is false comfort.
2. **Identify the swing variable**: Which assumption matters most? Spend extra time justifying that one.
3. **Use base rates**: When unsure, start from known rates (e.g., smartphone penetration ~85% in US).
4. **Think in orders of magnitude**: Is the answer millions, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions? Getting the order right matters more than the exact number.
5. **Communicate your uncertainty**: "This could be off by 2-3x, but the order of magnitude should be right."
6. **Show your work**: The process matters more than the final number — interviewers want to see structured analytical thinking.
