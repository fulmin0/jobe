# Behavioral Frameworks

## STAR Method

**Use for:** All behavioral interview questions

### Structure
- **S**ituation (10% of answer) — Set the scene. When, where, what was the context? Keep it brief.
- **T**ask (10% of answer) — What was your specific role and responsibility? What was the challenge?
- **A**ction (60% of answer) — What did YOU do? Be specific. Detail your thought process, decisions, and steps taken. Use "I" not "we."
- **R**esult (20% of answer) — What was the outcome? Quantify if possible. What did you learn?

### When to Use
- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "Give me an example of..."
- "Describe a situation where..."
- Any question asking for a specific past experience

### Time Proportions
The most common mistake is spending too long on Situation/Task. The interviewer cares most about your Actions and Results. Aim for a 2-3 minute total answer.

### Common Mistakes
- Spending 50%+ on situation/task setup (keep it under 30 seconds)
- Using "we" instead of "I" — interviewers want YOUR contribution
- No quantified results ("it went well" vs "we increased retention by 15%")
- Not having a clear takeaway or learning
- Stories that are too old (prefer last 2-3 years)
- Choosing safe, low-stakes examples instead of genuinely challenging ones

## SOAR Method (Variation for leadership stories)

**Use for:** Leadership, influence, and impact questions

### Structure
- **S**ituation — Brief context
- **O**bstacle — What stood in the way? What made this hard?
- **A**ction — What you did, with emphasis on leadership and influence
- **R**esult — Outcome with emphasis on team/organizational impact

### When to Use
- "Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult situation"
- "How do you handle conflict?"
- "Describe your leadership style"

## Story Bank Preparation

### Categories to Prepare (have 2-3 stories for each)

1. **Leadership / Influence**: Leading without authority, driving alignment, motivating a team
2. **Conflict / Disagreement**: Handling pushback, navigating competing priorities, resolving interpersonal issues
3. **Failure / Mistake**: What went wrong, how you handled it, what you learned
4. **Data-Driven Decision**: Using data to make or change a decision, convincing others with evidence
5. **Ambiguity / Ownership**: Taking initiative when direction was unclear, defining the problem before solving it
6. **Collaboration**: Working cross-functionally, bridging engineering and business, customer partnerships
7. **Customer Focus**: Going above and beyond for users, using customer insights to drive product decisions
8. **Innovation / Creativity**: Novel approach, challenging the status quo, shipping something new

### Story Quality Checklist
- [ ] Happened in the last 2-3 years
- [ ] Involves meaningful stakes (not trivial)
- [ ] Shows clear personal contribution (not just team effort)
- [ ] Has quantified or specific results
- [ ] Demonstrates the competency being assessed
- [ ] Can be told in 2-3 minutes
- [ ] Has a genuine learning or growth element

## Common Behavioral Question Patterns

### Leadership Principles (Amazon-style)
- **Customer Obsession**: "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer."
- **Ownership**: "Tell me about a time you took on something outside your area of responsibility."
- **Bias for Action**: "Tell me about a time you made a decision without perfect information."
- **Earn Trust**: "Tell me about a time you had to deliver difficult feedback."
- **Dive Deep**: "Tell me about a time you had to dig into the details to find the root cause."

### Meta/Google-style
- "Tell me about your most impactful project. What made it impactful?"
- "Tell me about a time you had to influence a team you didn't manage."
- "Describe a situation where you had to make a trade-off between user experience and business goals."
- "Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn?"

## Behavioral Principles

1. **Be specific**: Names, dates, numbers, actual quotes if you remember them.
2. **Own your actions**: "I decided," "I proposed," "I convinced" — not "we agreed."
3. **Show the thinking**: Don't just say what you did. Explain WHY you chose that approach.
4. **Honest reflection**: Genuine self-awareness is more impressive than a perfect story.
5. **Practice out loud**: Behavioral answers need to be practiced verbally, not just outlined.
