# Behavioral Frameworks

Frameworks synthesized from Dianna Yau video transcript knowledge base with citations. Behavioral receives lightweight transcript coverage — two videos cover the "favorite product" question specifically, and videos reference STAR proportions.

## Favorite Product Framework (4-Part)
**Source:** `TsYpCng2Pfg` — The Most Common Product Interview Question
**Use for:** "What is your favorite product and why? How would you improve it?"

### Steps
1. **Motivation** — What problem does this product solve? Educate the interviewer on the problem space before diving into the product itself.
2. **Users & Value** — Who uses it? What value does each user type get? (Often a multi-sided ecosystem — identify supply and demand.)
3. **Why It's My Favorite** — Demonstrate two distinct skills:
   - **Strategic thinking**: Business model viability, supply/demand dynamics, competitive positioning, sustainability
   - **Product sense**: Specific design choices that drive business goals, UX decisions that create delight or reduce friction
4. **How to Improve** — Identify pain points connected to key business metrics → Propose prioritized solutions based on impact.

### Example Application (Too Good To Go)
- Motivation: Food waste is a massive problem — restaurants throw away unsold food, consumers want deals
- Users: Restaurants (supply, reduce waste + earn revenue on would-be-discarded food), Consumers (demand, get deals + feel good)
- Why favorite: Rare product that makes you feel good using it. Sustainable business model with clear value for both sides.
- Improvements: Trust-building for new users (first purchase anxiety), convenience features (pickup timing, location)

### Tips
- Choose a product you genuinely use and have told friends about — authentic passion is obvious
- "How often can you say that about a product? [that it makes you feel good] Most products you use you'll feel like 'oh I'm spending way too much time' or 'I'm spending way too much money'"
- Avoid products that are too complex (hard to explain in time) or too commonly chosen (Google, Amazon — interviewer has heard it 100 times)

## Favorite Product Framework (3-Part)
**Source:** `k4wtOqReb3A` — Favorite Product: How Would You Improve It?
**Use for:** Lighter alternative for the same question

### Steps
1. **Pick Product** — Choose something you genuinely love. Use your phone to demo if the interviewer isn't familiar.
2. **Identify Needs & Pain Points** — Show strategic thinking by identifying problems the product solves, not just listing features you like. Think about the user journey end-to-end.
3. **Strategic Opportunities** — Connect improvements to the company's revenue model and growth strategy. Don't just list features you wish existed — show business impact.

### Example Application (Yelp)
Three key needs: Discovery (finding restaurants), Information for Decision-Making (reviews, photos, menus), Direct Connection to Business (reservations, ordering). Improvements aligned to strengthening these pillars and closing gaps competitors exploit.

### Tips
- "Most interviewers don't necessarily come very prepared. So they go to the first question that they can think of. So please don't fail the easy question"
- "They're not asking you to rant about your favorite product — they're asking for a structured and strategic viewpoint" (`vpsUw1vP8w4`)
- Common mistake: Listing features you wish existed rather than thinking about target users and their generalizable pain points

## STAR Proportions
**Referenced across multiple videos**
**Use for:** All behavioral/story-based interview questions

### Structure
- **S**ituation (10% of answer) — Set the scene briefly. When, where, what was the context.
- **T**ask (10% of answer) — What was your specific role and responsibility? What was the challenge?
- **A**ction (60% of answer) — What did YOU do? Be specific. Detail your thought process, decisions, and steps. Use "I" not "we."
- **R**esult (20% of answer) — What was the outcome? Quantify if possible. What did you learn?

### Tips
- The most common mistake is spending too long on Situation/Task — keep setup under 30 seconds
- Aim for 2-3 minutes total answer length
- Use "I decided," "I proposed," "I convinced" — not "we agreed"
- Quantify results whenever possible ("increased retention by 15%" vs. "it went well")

## Behavioral Principles from Videos

1. **Authenticity matters** — Genuine passion and honest reflection are more impressive than polished stories
2. **Strategic thinking shows everywhere** — Even in behavioral answers, demonstrate you think about business impact, not just user delight
3. **Practice quality over quantity** — "There's no such thing as too much practice, but it's quality of practice over quantity... recording myself was really helpful" (`WdssgqA5-aI`)
4. **Product selection signals judgment** — The product you choose and why reveals your taste, strategic thinking, and empathy
5. **Energy matters** — "Strong energy and enthusiasm throughout the interview makes a huge difference in perception" (`WdssgqA5-aI`)
