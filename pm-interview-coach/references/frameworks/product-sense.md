## Core 4-Part Product Sense Framework
**Source:** `8QybwDJk0Ek` — Product Sense/Design Interviews: How to Answer
**Use for:** All product sense questions (design new, improve existing, fix a problem)

### Steps
1. **Why / Mission & Market Landscape** — Validate the opportunity. Trends, market gaps, mission alignment, company strengths. Think of this as an investor pitch.
2. **Who / Target Users** — Map ecosystem, segment by behavior (not demographics), prioritize with objective criteria.
3. **What / User Journeys & Pain Points** — Walk through the user journey step-by-step, identify specific frustrations and inefficiencies, prioritize by impact.
4. **How / Creative Solutions** — Brainstorm 3-5 solutions tied to specific pain points, prioritize by impact vs. effort.

### 5 Key Skills Being Assessed
1. **Information Gathering** — Clarifying questions, scoping the problem, understanding the space
2. **Structure** — Organizing thinking in mutually exclusive buckets, sharing structure upfront
3. **Prioritization** — Using objective criteria at every decision point (segments, pain points, solutions)
4. **User Empathy** — Concrete personal experiences, emotional depth, granular pain points
5. **Creative Brainstorming** — Differentiated solutions from specific pain points, technology application

### Time Allocation
**Source:** `aDRVDvxnDR8` — Get FASTER at Product Design/Sense Interview Questions

Target ~30 minutes of talking time out of 45-minute interview:
- **Intro / Clarifying questions:** 3 minutes
- **Why build this (motivation):** 5 minutes (2 min landscape, 1 min mission alignment, 2 min strengths)
- **User segments:** 5 minutes (3 min segmentation, 2 min prioritization)
- **Pain points:** 10 minutes (2-3 min journey, 5 min pain points, 2-3 min prioritization)
- **Solutions:** 7 minutes (5 min generating, 2 min prioritizing)

### Tips
- "Your first 1 to 3 solutions are most likely going to be the most common solutions that 95% of the candidates are going to say. The last couple are going to help you peel away from your competition"
- Master content first, then optimize for speed
- Save time by making explicit assumptions instead of asking generic questions

## Subtype: Design New Product

### Motivation / Why Framework
**Source:** `X5Wv8S3Jxlc` — Meta/Facebook Product Sense Interview: Why Should We Build This?
**Use for:** Opening section of any "build a product for X" question

#### Steps
1. **Trends** — What macro trends make this space interesting right now? (technology shifts, behavioral changes, market growth)
2. **Opportunities** — What is the market size (TAM)? What gaps exist? How does this align with company mission?
3. **Strengths & Weaknesses** — What unique assets does the company bring? What competitive advantages exist? What are the risks?

#### Tips
- "Most candidates rush through one of the most important parts of the question and fail to show strategic thinking"
- Spend ~5 minutes here — don't skip or abbreviate
- Think of this section as an investor pitch or CEO pitch (`KruFg7-9qBM`)
- Always strategically assess whether the interviewing company should build in this space — never assume yes (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)
- Avoid generic mission alignment: "I literally could have given the candidate any space and they would have just said yes it's aligned with the mission because I'm connecting the demand side and supply side"

### User Segmentation Framework
**Source:** `ArgWgjasRqQ` — Product Sense Interviews: Segmenting Users

#### Steps
1. **Map the Ecosystem** — Identify all players (supply side, demand side, third parties, creators, etc.)
2. **Segment by Behavior** — Group users by what they do, not who they are. Behavior-based segments reveal different pain points.
   - Ensure segments are **MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Comprehensively Exhaustive
   - Cover 80%+ of the user base
   - Each segment should have noticeably different pain points
3. **Prioritize with Scoring Matrix** — Pick 2-3 objective criteria, score each segment 1-5 relative to others, multiply scores
   - Criteria examples: TAM/population size, frequency of use, willingness to spend, how underserved they are

#### Example Application
From `WdssgqA5-aI` (fitness product for Meta): Creators → Third parties (gyms, studios) → End users segmented by motivation level (Low / Medium / High). Medium motivation prioritized: largest reach, most impact, most underserved.

#### Common Mistakes
- Segmenting by demographics (age, gender) instead of behavior — "It's not wrong, it's pretty generic"
- Not being MECE: "mothers who travel + people who travel with kids = overlap" (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)
- Subjective prioritization: "business travelers have the most needs" — use objective criteria instead
- Being too broad OR too granular

### Pain Point Framework
**Source:** `18vWpDiL75Q` — Product Sense Interview: Pain Points

#### Steps
1. **Create User Journey** — Start with most recent concrete personal experience. Break down into granular steps — specificity reveals pain points.
2. **Identify Pain Points** — Look for both frustrating experiences AND suboptimal/inefficient ones. Don't ignore existing solutions.
3. **Prioritize Pain Points** — Use objective criteria:
   - How many people are affected?
   - How severe is the pain?
   - Are there existing solutions?

#### Tips
- "Break down and get as specific as you can. Because the more specific you get, the more you can empathize with the user. And the more opportunities you'll get to find really interesting pain points"
- Come up with **pain points**, not just needs — "Think about what sucks in each of these parts" (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)
- Bad: "deciding what place to go to, organizing trip, coordinating" (these are needs)
- Good: "not having enough information... fragmented... hard to compare" (these are pain points with emotional depth)

### Three Spheres of Empathy
**Source:** `KruFg7-9qBM` — Product Sense Interview Tips (ADVANCED)
**Use for:** Developing pain points when you lack direct personal experience

1. **Personal Experience** — Draw from your own usage of the product or space
2. **Secondary Experience** — Draw from stories of friends, family, colleagues, reviews, forums
3. **Visualization** — Imagine yourself as the user, walk through the journey mentally step-by-step

### Creative Solution Brainstorming
**Source:** `kKNvHDRXgAc` — Product Sense Interviews: Solutions

#### Three Techniques
1. **Identify Specific Pain Points** — The more granular the pain point, the more creative and differentiated the solution. Generic pain points → generic solutions that already exist.
2. **Apply Technologies & Trends** — AI, AR/VR, short-form video, influencer marketing. But don't use jargon without substance — explain the specific user experience.
   - Bad: "use VR and AR to help decide where to go"
   - Good: "VR/AR experience to put users in multiple places simultaneously to feel pyramids vs rainforests"
3. **Borrow from Other Verticals** — Look at how other industries solve similar problems. Cross-pollination drives innovation.

#### Tips
- "The best way to avoid falling into this trap [generic solutions] is just avoiding generic pain points entirely"
- Acknowledge existing solutions, then build an innovative layer on top (`JJfLOSRY1hk`)

## Subtype: Improve Existing Product / Favorite Product

### 4-Part Favorite Product Framework
**Source:** `TsYpCng2Pfg` — The Most Common Product Interview Question
**Use for:** "What is your favorite product and why? How would you improve it?"

#### Steps
1. **Motivation** — What problem does this product solve? Educate the interviewer on the problem space.
2. **Users & Value** — Who uses it? What value does each user type get? (Often a multi-sided ecosystem)
3. **Why It's My Favorite** — Demonstrate two things:
   - **Strategic thinking**: Business model, sustainability, supply/demand dynamics, competitive moat
   - **Product sense**: Specific design choices that drive business goals, UX decisions that create delight
4. **How to Improve** — Identify pain points connected to key business metrics → Propose prioritized solutions

#### Example Application (Too Good To Go)
- Motivation: Food waste problem + consumer value
- Users: Restaurants (supply), consumers (demand)
- Why favorite: Makes you feel good (rare for apps), sustainable business model
- Improvements: Trust-building for new users, convenience features

### 3-Part Favorite Product Framework
**Source:** `k4wtOqReb3A` — Favorite Product: How Would You Improve It?
**Use for:** Lighter alternative for the same question type

#### Steps
1. **Pick Product** — Choose something you genuinely love and have told friends about. Avoid products too complex or too commonly chosen (Google, Amazon).
2. **Identify Needs & Pain Points** — Show strategic thinking by identifying problems solved, not just features. Use phone to demo if interviewer isn't familiar.
3. **Strategic Opportunities** — Connect improvements to company's revenue model and growth strategy. Don't just list features you wish existed.

#### Example Application (Yelp)
Three key needs identified: Discovery, Information for Decision-Making, Direct Connection to Business. Improvements aligned to strengthening these pillars.

#### Tips
- "Most interviewers don't necessarily come very prepared. So they go to the first question that they can think of. So please don't fail the easy question"
- Pick a product you've actively told friends about — genuine passion shows
- Show both strategic thinking (business model, sustainability) AND product sense (design choices, UX)

## Subtype: Fix a Problem / Worst Experience

### Marketplace Metrics Selection
**Source:** `dz-hqOih9qY` — Product Sense Mock Interview for DoorDash
**Use for:** Choosing the right metric for marketplace products, especially "worst experience" questions

#### Approach
1. **Consider metrics for ALL sides** of the marketplace (hosts + guests + platform)
2. **Reject ill-fitting metrics with explicit reasoning:**
   - Retention → Rejected for infrequent-use products (can't distinguish bad experience from low travel frequency)
   - Rating → Rejected because only extreme experiences get rated, not representative
3. **Select metric capturing intersection of value for all parties**
   - Example: "Number of nights booked and stayed" — hosts make money, guests get value, Airbnb gets revenue

### Preventative vs. Reactive Solutions
**Source:** `dz-hqOih9qY` — Product Sense Mock Interview for DoorDash
**Use for:** "Worst experience" or "fix a problem" questions

#### Two Solution Buckets
1. **Prevention** — Stop the problem before it happens
   - Example: Inactive host detection via ML, confirmation check systems
2. **Recovery** — Handle it well when it happens anyway
   - Example: Priority rebooking, hotel partnerships, alternative experiences

"You can't make everything perfect, but if you can make up for it, users can still be happy and choose Airbnb. Their customer service is so good."

### Pain Severity Assessment
**Use for:** "Worst experience" questions specifically

- Weight **pain/impact** over frequency for "worst" questions
- "I would weight frequency less for 'worst experience' — even 1% of Airbnb users is still a large user group"
- Low frequency + high severity can still be the right priority

## Subtype: Niche / Unfamiliar Spaces

### Mission Alignment Assessment
**Source:** `EOwkN1gQfsk` — Meta/Facebook Product Sense/Design Mock Interview
**Use for:** Questions in unfamiliar spaces, or when the product may not fit the company

#### Steps
1. **Evaluate Trends** — Is this space growing? What macro trends support it?
2. **Assess Market Size** — Is the TAM large enough to be meaningful?
3. **Determine Mission Alignment** — Does this honestly fit the company's stated mission?
4. **Consider Company Strengths** — Does the company have relevant assets, technology, or user base?
5. **Assess Business Benefit** — Can this generate meaningful revenue or strategic advantage?
6. **Make Honest Recommendation** — It's acceptable (often impressive) to conclude a product doesn't fit the company. Recommend standalone startup if appropriate.

#### Example Application (Antiques for Facebook)
Concluded antiques marketplace doesn't fit Facebook's mission. Instead positioned as standalone startup with three-pronged strategy: drive supply, ensure positive experiences, improve discovery.

#### Tips
- "The first thing is truthfully assessing does this fit within the Facebook product ecosystem and not just force fitting it"
- When unfamiliar with the space, use visualization and imagination to develop empathy
- Clarify scope of broad topics upfront (antiques: expensive collector items vs. cheap vintage finds)

## Value Chain Analysis
**Source:** `zR2A14v5Awg` — Meta/Facebook Product Sense Mock Interview
**Use for:** Narrowing broad problem spaces ("build a product in the travel space")

### Approach
1. Map the entire value chain end-to-end
2. Identify which stages are overserved vs. underserved
3. Focus on the underserved niche

### Example (Travel)
Discovery → Journey/Booking → Stay → Itinerary & Local Experiences → Memory Sharing

Prioritization criteria: Reach, Frequency, ARPU, Underserved vs. Overserved

### Tips
- "Fall in love with the problem and not solution"
- Start with "why" — validate market entry before diving into solutions

---

## Ecosystem Analysis — Supply & Demand
**Source:** `PU635pDoxy4` — Creative Product Sense Mock Interview
**Use for:** Marketplace products or two-sided platforms

### Approach
1. Understand company's existing strengths before proposing solutions
2. Consider BOTH sides of marketplace — need healthy supply to serve demand
3. Segment each side by behavior (especially by frequency of availability/use)
4. Map user journeys for supply side AND demand side separately
5. Build trust mechanisms: photos, reviews, ratings

### Example (Google Maps Parking)
- Supply side: Public street → Private malls → Parking lots → Spot owners (prioritized) → Restaurants
- Demand side: Short-term/last-minute (prioritized) → Long-term → Medium-term
- "We need a healthy ecosystem for this to work — if you have healthy supply, demand can find spots"

## Common Mistakes Reference
**Source:** `JJfLOSRY1hk` — Product Sense/Design Interviews: Common Mistakes

Mistakes make candidates appear: scripted, question-dependent, needing hand-holding, or subjective rather than data-driven.

| Section | Bad | Good |
|---------|-----|------|
| Clarifying Qs | "Should this be mobile or desktop?" | "Should we consider pre/during/post-COVID?" |
| Motivation | "Facebook's mission is to connect people... we're connecting grocery stores and people shopping" | Strategic assessment of mission, strengths, market opportunity |
| Segmentation | "Business travelers have the most needs" (subjective) | Objective criteria: population size, frequency, willingness to spend |
| Pain Points | "Deciding what place to go to" (a need, not a pain point) | "Not having enough information... fragmented... hard to compare" |
| Solutions | "Use VR and AR to help decide where to go" (jargon) | "VR/AR experience to feel pyramids vs rainforests simultaneously" |
