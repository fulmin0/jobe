# Product Sense Frameworks

## CIRCLES Framework

**Use for:** Product design questions, product improvement questions

### Steps
1. **C**omprehend the Situation — Clarify the prompt. What is the product? Who is the company? What are the constraints? Ask clarifying questions.
2. **I**dentify the Customer — Define 2-3 user segments. Pick one to focus on and justify why.
3. **R**eport Customer Needs — List pain points and unmet needs for your chosen segment. Use day-in-the-life thinking.
4. **C**ut Through Prioritization — Rank needs by impact (how painful) and frequency (how often). Pick the top need.
5. **L**ist Solutions — Brainstorm 3-5 solutions for the prioritized need. Range from simple to ambitious.
6. **E**valuate Trade-offs — Compare solutions on user impact, feasibility, business alignment, and timeline.
7. **S**ummarize Recommendation — State your recommendation clearly with the reasoning chain.

### When to Use
- "Design a product for X"
- "How would you improve Y"
- "Build a feature for Z"
- Any question asking you to think about product design from scratch or iterate on existing products

### Common Mistakes
- Jumping to solutions without understanding users (skipping I and R)
- Picking a user segment without justifying the choice
- Only proposing one solution instead of exploring the space
- Not defining success metrics at the end
- Being too generic ("make it easier to use") instead of specific

### Example Application
**Q: "How would you improve Instagram for creators?"**
- C: Clarify — Instagram is a social media platform owned by Meta. Creators range from hobbyists to professionals. Focus on the mobile app.
- I: Segments — Hobbyist creators, micro-influencers (10K-100K followers), professional creators (100K+). Focus on micro-influencers: growing fastest, most engaged, highest potential value.
- R: Needs — Struggling with reach (algorithm favors big accounts), limited monetization options, no way to understand what content works.
- C: Prioritize — Analytics and reach insights (highest pain, daily frustration).
- L: Solutions — (1) Creator analytics dashboard, (2) Reach boost for consistent posters, (3) Content idea suggestions based on trends.
- E: Trade-offs — Dashboard is most feasible and directly addresses the top pain point.
- S: Recommend the analytics dashboard with specific metrics and success criteria.

## BUS Framework

**Use for:** Product improvement questions, product strategy questions

### Steps
1. **B**usiness Context — What are the company's goals? Current state? Key metrics?
2. **U**ser Understanding — Who uses it? What are their journeys? Where are the pain points?
3. **S**olutions — Propose improvements that align with both business goals and user needs.

### When to Use
- "How would you improve [existing product]?"
- When you need a lighter framework than CIRCLES
- When the business context is particularly important

### Common Mistakes
- Ignoring the business side and only focusing on user delight
- Proposing solutions that don't move key business metrics
- Not connecting user pain points to business outcomes

## Product Sense Principles

These apply across all product design questions:

1. **Start with the user**: Always ground your answer in real user needs, not technology capabilities.
2. **Be specific**: Name specific user personas, specific pain points, specific solutions. Avoid "some users might..."
3. **Think in trade-offs**: Every product decision has trade-offs. Name them explicitly.
4. **Define success**: End with how you would measure if this worked.
5. **Consider the ecosystem**: How does this feature interact with the rest of the product? Does it cannibalize something?
