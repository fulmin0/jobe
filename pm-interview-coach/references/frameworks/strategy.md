## Subtype: Long-term Roadmap / Vision

### Product Strategy Framework (3-Part)
**Source:** `RpAgs1z4K_0` — Product Strategy Interviews: How to Answer (Google Product Interviews)
**Use for:** "What should [company] build next?" / "Define a product strategy for X"

#### Steps
1. **Company** — Understand the company's foundation
   - Mission and core themes
   - Current investments and product lines
   - Key strengths and competitive advantages
   - Primary goal (growth, retention, monetization, diversification)

2. **Ecosystem** — Analyze the external landscape
   - Users and their evolving needs
   - Gaps in current offerings
   - Industry trends and technology shifts
   - Competitor positioning and moves
   - Opportunity areas at intersection of gaps + trends + strengths

3. **Execution** — Build the strategic narrative
   - Compelling narrative connecting company strengths to opportunity
   - Phased roadmap (now / next / later)
   - Concrete next steps and milestones
   - Risks and mitigation strategies

### Mission Breakdown + Goal Selection
**Source:** `um3SiBM82do` — Google's Product Strategy Interview
**Use for:** Strategy questions for specific companies, especially Google-style

#### Steps
1. **Parse Mission into Themes** — Break the company's mission statement into 2-3 core themes that guide all strategy
2. **Select a Goal** — Choose one strategic direction and defend it:
   - Diversify into new markets
   - Compete more effectively in existing markets
   - Grow current user base
   - Innovate with new technology or approach
3. **Defend with Criteria** — Explain why this goal over others (market size, strategic fit, timing, competitive pressure)
4. **Think in Challenges, Not Pain Points** — Frame problems as strategic challenges the company faces, not just user frustrations
5. **Product Suites, Not Features** — Propose comprehensive product strategies, not isolated feature additions

#### Tips
- Strategy questions test CEO-level thinking — zoom out from features to business direction
- Connect everything back to mission themes identified in step 1
- Show you understand trade-offs between strategic directions

## Subtype: Market Entry

### 6-Part Market Entry Framework
**Source:** `4RGlcs-_Ke0` — Product Strategy Interviews: Market Entry
**Use for:** "Should [company] enter [market]?" / "Should Amazon build smartphones?"

#### Steps
1. **Goal / Motivation** — Why is the company considering this market? What strategic objective does it serve? (Revenue diversification, user growth, competitive defense, ecosystem completion)

2. **Market Evaluation** — Assess the market on five dimensions:
   - **Size** — TAM, current revenue in the space
   - **Growth** — Is the market expanding or contracting?
   - **Competitors** — Who are the incumbents? How strong are their moats?
   - **Customers** — Who are the buyers? What do they value?
   - **Macro factors** — Regulation, technology shifts, cultural trends

3. **Company Strengths** — What unique assets does the company bring? (Technology, user base, brand, distribution, data, partnerships)

4. **Cost to Enter** — What is the investment required? (R&D, marketing, operations, talent, time-to-market)

5. **Decision Tree** — Frame as "Yes if... No if..."
   - Yes if: Large growing market + clear strength advantage + manageable cost + strategic alignment
   - No if: Dominated by entrenched competitors + no differentiation + high cost + mission distraction

6. **Entry Method** — If yes, how?
   - **Build** — Build in-house (full control, slow, expensive)
   - **Partner** — Strategic partnership (faster, shared risk, less control)
   - **Acquire** — Buy an existing player (fastest, most expensive, integration risk)

### Market Sizing Example
**Source:** `4RGlcs-_Ke0`

Global population (7B) → smartphone users (3.5B) → annual purchases (1B yearly) → target share (5%) → revenue math. "Even imperfect math is better than none."

#### Tips
- Don't just say "yes" or "no" — show the analytical framework that leads to your conclusion
- Consider opportunity cost — what else could the company invest in instead?
- Be honest about risks even if recommending entry

## Subtype: Go-to-Market

### 5-Step GTM Framework
**Source:** `KYkT7I2wZh8` — Product Interviews: Go-to-Market Strategy in 5 Steps
**Use for:** "How would you launch [product]?" / "Design a GTM strategy for X"

#### Steps
1. **Success Metrics** — Define what "successful launch" looks like before planning how to get there. What are the North Star metrics for launch?

2. **Who (Target Audience)** — Define your initial target using observable, targetable attributes
   - Not just demographics — identify behavioral signals
   - Who are the early adopters most likely to convert?
   - What signals can you use to find them?

3. **What (Positioning)** — Craft the message in 1-2 adjectives
   - What is the core value proposition?
   - How is this different from alternatives?
   - What emotional response should the marketing evoke?

4. **Where (Channels)** — Identify where your target audience actually is
   - **Channel Discovery Questions:**
     - What countries/regions are they in?
     - Where do they physically hang out?
     - What content do they consume? (blogs, YouTube, podcasts, social media)
     - Who are their influencers and trusted voices?
   - Match channel to audience behavior, not just reach

5. **When (Timing)** — Optimize launch timing across three dimensions:
   - **Seasonality** — Holiday seasons, back-to-school, tax season
   - **Time of day** — When are users most receptive? (Morning for meditation, evening for entertainment)
   - **Life occasions** — Moving, graduating, having a baby, starting a job

#### Example Application
Apple's 1997 "Here's to the Crazy Ones" campaign: targeted innovators (who), aspirational/rebellious positioning (what), matched to channels where creative people were (where), during Apple's comeback moment (when).

#### Tips
- "It's important to deliver your message at the right time, at the right place... when people are open to listening to a marketing message"
- Don't blast everyone — precision targeting converts better than broad reach
- Consider both digital and physical channels

## Subtype: Monetization

### 4-Part Monetization Framework
**Source:** `xJVx06LQXww` — Product Strategy Interviews: Monetization
**Use for:** "How would you monetize [product]?" / "Design a business model for X"

#### Steps
1. **Understand the Product** — What it does, how it works, key features, unique challenges for monetization
2. **Who Are the Users and What Do They Need?** — Consumer vs. business users, distinct goals for each segment
3. **Monetization Models** — Evaluate which models fit the product (see 6 models below)
4. **Solutions** — Develop 2-3 specific features that implement chosen models, prioritize by ROI

### 6 Monetization Models
**Source:** `xJVx06LQXww`

| Model | Description | Best For | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Subscription** | Recurring payment for access | Ongoing value, habit products | Netflix, Amazon Prime |
| **Freemium** | Free base + paid premium features | Large user base, clear upgrade path | Spotify (free with ads → paid premium) |
| **Ads** | Sell attention to advertisers | High-traffic entertainment/media | Google, Facebook, Forbes |
| **Transaction Fees** | Take cut of each transaction | Marketplaces, payment platforms | Airbnb, DoorDash (charge both sides) |
| **Selling Goods/Services** | Digital or physical goods | Platform with creator ecosystem | YouTube stickers, consulting packages |
| **Licensing** | Pay per user seat | Enterprise/B2B products | Oracle, Salesforce |

### Example Application (WhatsApp)
**Challenge:** Messaging apps are uniquely hard to monetize — commoditized (users won't pay) and intimate (hard to inject commercial activity like ads).

**Solutions developed:**
1. Transaction fees on in-app stores (businesses sell directly through WhatsApp)
2. Digital goods marketplace (sticker/GIF packs, inspired by WeChat)
3. Freemium model (free base, premium with higher group limits)
4. Gifting with transaction fees (buy Starbucks for a friend, inspired by Korean apps)

#### Tips
- "Most successful businesses mix and match multiple models to diversify revenue streams"
- "What's important about designing monetization models is designing experiences that won't isolate your users"
- "Inspiration is everywhere — whatever product you're using most likely has a monetization model. Look at it with a critical lens"
- Look at international products (WeChat, KakaoTalk) for creative monetization approaches

## Subtype: Growth

### Growth First Principles
**Source:** `AQWUOY_zsWM` — Growth Hacking: How Companies Like TikTok Got 1 Billion Users
**Use for:** "How would you grow [product]?" / "What growth strategy would you recommend?"

#### Three Principles

1. **Product-Market Fit First** — Never invest heavily in growth without PMF
   - **Qualitative test:** Survey asking "How sad would you be without this product?" (Superhuman used this)
   - **Quantitative test:** Non-zero retention rate after X days (>30% after 1 year is strong)
   - Example: Superhuman CEO iterated until users reported being "very sad"

2. **Growth is a Game of Inches** — 1% improvements compound over time
   - Synergistic effect: combined tactics > sum of individual components
   - Learn which levers work and their impact sizes through systematic experimentation

3. **Balance is Key** — Don't sacrifice long-term success for short-term wins
   - Example: Zillow over-emailing led to users completely blocking them
   - "You don't want to give up long-term success for short-term wins"

### 8 Growth Tactics (3 Categories)
**Source:** `AQWUOY_zsWM`

#### Category 1: Increasing Conversion
1. **Shorten the Funnel** — Remove unnecessary steps. TikTok shows content BEFORE requiring signup. Question each step: "Do we really need this?"
2. **Smart Defaults** — Preset choices make decisions easier. Wikipedia donation amounts, restaurant tipping tablets (15%/20%/25%), TurboTax saving info year-over-year.
3. **Save Unfinished Progress** — Sephora saves cart even when not logged in. Follow up with email reminders. Incorporation forms let you resume where you left off.

#### Category 2: Targeting
4. **Behavioral > Demographic Targeting** — Dick's Sporting Goods retargets users who selected a size but didn't checkout. Target based on actions, not age/gender.
5. **Right Placement** — Airlines offer travel insurance, car rentals, hotels at checkout. Put offers in context of existing actions.
6. **Right Time** — YouTube shows meditation in morning, music at night. Learn when users are most likely to complete desired actions.

#### Category 3: Content & Visuals
7. **Test Content** — Create urgency, curiosity gaps, personalization (names in emails increase opens), aspirational vs. instructional text, localize to user's language.
8. **Leverage Visuals** — Airbnb sent professional photographers to homes because photos drive bookings. "Visuals capture attention more than text." Show pain points or aspirations.

### Case Studies
- **TikTok:** Grew to 1B+ users in <5 years by showing content before signup (shortened funnel)
- **Facebook:** 1M users in <1 year, 600M in 6 years
- **Sephora:** Cart persistence creates conversion from abandoned sessions
- **Airbnb:** Professional photography dramatically increased bookings
- **Dick's Sporting Goods:** Behavioral retargeting on size selection

#### Tips
- "The more steps you add for users to complete an action, the less likely they're going to do it"
- "Making a decision is easier with smart defaults — we know from high school how much easier multiple choice was than fill-in-the-blank"
- Growth is experimentation — learn which levers work through systematic testing, not intuition
