# Strategy Frameworks

## Porter's Five Forces

**Use for:** Competitive analysis, market entry decisions

### Forces
1. **Competitive Rivalry** — How intense is competition? Number of competitors, growth rate, differentiation, switching costs.
2. **Threat of New Entrants** — How easy is it for new players to enter? Capital requirements, regulatory barriers, network effects, brand loyalty.
3. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** — How much leverage do suppliers have? Number of suppliers, uniqueness of inputs, switching costs.
4. **Bargaining Power of Buyers** — How much leverage do customers have? Concentration, price sensitivity, availability of alternatives.
5. **Threat of Substitutes** — What alternatives exist? Performance of substitutes, switching costs, buyer propensity to substitute.

### When to Use
- "Should [company] enter [market]?"
- "Analyze the competitive landscape of X"
- "What are the threats to [product]'s position?"

### Common Mistakes
- Only analyzing direct competitors (missing substitutes and new entrants)
- Listing forces without drawing conclusions about attractiveness
- Not connecting the analysis back to a strategic recommendation

## TAM / SAM / SOM

**Use for:** Market sizing, opportunity assessment

### Definitions
- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) — Total demand for the product/service globally if 100% market share
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) — Portion of TAM reachable with your business model, geography, and capabilities
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) — Realistic portion of SAM you can capture given competition, go-to-market, and resources

### How to Calculate
- **Top-down**: Start from industry reports, total market size, then narrow by segments
- **Bottom-up**: Start from unit economics, number of potential customers, average revenue per customer

### When to Use
- "How big is the opportunity for X?"
- Any strategy question requiring market sizing
- Investment or build-vs-buy decisions

## Competitive Moats

**Use for:** Evaluating sustainable competitive advantage

### Types of Moats
1. **Network Effects** — Product becomes more valuable as more users join (e.g., social networks, marketplaces)
2. **Switching Costs** — High cost or pain of moving to a competitor (e.g., enterprise software, data lock-in)
3. **Economies of Scale** — Cost advantages from volume (e.g., manufacturing, cloud infrastructure)
4. **Brand** — Consumer trust and recognition that drives preference (e.g., Apple, Nike)
5. **Data Advantage** — Proprietary data that improves the product over time (e.g., Google Search, recommendation engines)
6. **Regulatory/Legal** — Patents, licenses, regulatory barriers (e.g., pharma, telecom)

### When to Use
- "What is [company]'s competitive advantage?"
- "How would you defend against [competitor]?"
- "Is this market worth entering?"

## Strategy Principles

1. **Think in time horizons**: Now (0-6 months), Next (6-18 months), Later (18+ months). Different strategies for each.
2. **Identify the wedge**: What is the initial foothold? How do you expand from there?
3. **Consider second-order effects**: If you do X, how will competitors, users, and the market respond?
4. **Reversibility matters**: Prefer reversible decisions when uncertain. Invest more analysis in irreversible ones.
5. **Strategy is about saying no**: What you choose NOT to do is as important as what you do.
