- **Frameworks Covered:** User Segmentation Framework, MECE Principle, Scoring Matrix for Prioritization
- **Difficulty Level:** intermediate

## Summary
This video teaches candidates how to segment users effectively for product sense interviews. The framework includes mapping the ecosystem first, applying key segmentation principles (behavior over demographics, MECE), and using a scoring system borrowed from venture capital to prioritize which user segment to build for. The approach emphasizes avoiding generic demographic segments in favor of behavioral segmentation.

## Key Takeaways
1. Map the entire ecosystem before segmenting to understand stakeholder relationships and incentives
2. Segment by behavior rather than demographics to avoid generic answers
3. Apply MECE principle: segments should be Mutually Exclusive and Comprehensively Exhaustive
4. Avoid niche segments for big tech companies that optimize for scale
5. Choose segments with noticeably different pain points from each other
6. Use objective scoring criteria (TAM, frequency, underserved population, spend) to prioritize segments
7. Score segments relative to each other on a 1-5 scale, then multiply scores across criteria

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### User Segmentation Framework (3-Step Process)
- **Step 1 - Map Ecosystem:** Understand the big picture and how stakeholders relate to end users
- **Step 2 - Segment Users:** Ask "who are the most frequent vs least frequent users?" to identify behavioral extremes
- **Step 3 - Prioritize Segments:** Use VC-style criteria to score and rank segments

### MECE Checklist for Segmentation
- Segment by behavior > demographics
- Ensure Mutually Exclusive (minimal overlap between groups)
- Ensure Comprehensively Exhaustive (cover 80%+ of population)
- Avoid niche segments for big tech
- Ensure different pain points between segments

### Prioritization Scoring Matrix
- Pick 2-3 criteria to optimize (e.g., TAM, frequency, spend)
- Score each segment 1-5 relative to others
- Multiply scores across criteria to identify highest impact segment

### Application Example (Finding Doctors)
- Ecosystem: Doctors → Hospitals/Clinics → Insurance → Patients
- Segments: Chronic illness patients (frequent), yearly checkup patients (infrequent), specialty consult patients (mid-frequency)
- Behavioral segmentation beats age-based (kids, adults, seniors)

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a product to help people find doctors (continuing from Part 1)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Defaulting to demographic segmentation (age groups) instead of behavioral
- Creating segments that aren't MECE (e.g., groups with large overlaps)
- Choosing segments without different pain points (makes solution phase harder)
- Not covering enough of the population (failing "comprehensively exhaustive" test)
- Subjective prioritization without clear objective criteria

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Segmenting by behavior is better than demographics - many candidates will default to segmenting by age... It's not wrong, it's pretty generic"
- "You want to make sure that your groups don't have a huge overlap between them... and comprehensively exhaustive means you want to cover as much of the population as possible. But I would say 80% is good enough"
- "Different pain points - you want to choose segments who have noticeably different pain points"
- "Let's borrow from the venture capital industry... they usually optimize for a couple criteria: total addressable market, frequency of use, building for an underserved population, and spend"
- "The score is relative to each other - for spend I come up with the score by comparing the chronic illness group with the group that needs specialty doctors"
