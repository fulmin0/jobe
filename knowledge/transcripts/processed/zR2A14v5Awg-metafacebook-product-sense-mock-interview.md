- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This video features a full product sense mock interview with Abhi, a Lead Product Manager at Square (formerly Senior PM at PayPal). The interview demonstrates a comprehensive approach to answering "What product would you build in the travel space?" The candidate navigates the ambiguity by first analyzing the travel value chain, identifying an underserved niche (local experiences and itineraries), then methodically working through users, pain points, and creative solutions with clear prioritization at each step.

## Key Takeaways
1. Start with "why" - validate market entry before diving into solutions by examining TAM, growth potential, macro conditions, and competitive landscape
2. Use value chain analysis to narrow broad problem spaces and identify underserved niches where innovation can create the most impact
3. Establish mission and business goals early to anchor all subsequent decisions and show strategic thinking
4. Always prioritize using explicit criteria (reach, frequency, ARPU) rather than jumping to intuitive choices
5. Focus deeply on the "why" and user problems rather than rushing to solutions - the best candidates "fall in love with the problem, not the solution"
6. Develop product sense by exposing yourself to many products through teardowns and actually using unfamiliar products to understand diverse user needs
7. Balance practical improvements with breakthrough innovation when choosing which part of the value chain to enter

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Travel Value Chain Analysis
- Discovery (Instagram, TripAdvisor)
- Journey/Booking (Expedia, United, Trip Actions)
- Stay (Airbnb, Booking.com, hotels)
- **Itinerary & Local Experiences** (identified gap)
- Memory Sharing (Instagram, Flickr)

### User Segmentation (Travelers)
- Family (prioritized: large reach, medium frequency, large ARPU)
- Solo travelers (small reach, medium frequency, medium-small ARPU)
- Friends/Groups (medium reach, large frequency, medium ARPU)

### Prioritization Framework
- Reach (market size)
- Frequency of use
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Underserved vs. overserved markets

### Solution Ideation & Naming
Each solution given a memorable "code name":
- **Local Lens** - connect to local guides for white-glove treatment
- **Trip Bunny** - AI-powered itinerary builder based on budget, time, preferences
- **Travel Buddies Insight** - leverage social graph for recommendations
- **Trip Marketplace** - user-generated itineraries marketplace with rewards
- **MapQuest** - road trip-focused map-based solution with pit stops

## Sample Questions Covered
- "What product would you build in the travel space?" (primary question)
- Implicit questions addressed: Why enter this space? Who are the users? What problems exist? How would you prioritize?

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Jumping straight to users and solutions without addressing the "why" - showing lack of strategic thinking
- Not leveraging value chain analysis for broad, ambiguous problem spaces
- Using generic frameworks without contextualizing them to the specific product
- Failing to establish clear mission and business goals that anchor later decisions
- Rambling about product features without structure or prioritization
- Not spending enough time on the "why" - the most differentiating part of strong answers

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Fall in love with the problem and not solution" - focus heavily on the why, mission, and business goals
- "Travel is the part of the journey that you remember the most" - used to craft mission around "beautiful memories"
- "Focus on where the end value lies" - when building marketplaces, prioritize the side that creates core value (travelers over service providers)
- "Growth is a game of entering here well, then expanding to adjacent areas" - start with underserved niche (local experiences), then expand to stay/journey
- "Expose yourself to more products through teardowns" - build product sense by understanding diverse products, even ones you don't use
- "I spent 9 years at PayPal working as Senior Product Manager" - demonstrates that strong product thinking is developed through exposure and practice
- On mission statements: "It's a bigger, higher calling that transcends more than just your product - it should inspire the team"
