- **Frameworks Covered:** Product Sense Framework (4-part), Strategic Thinking Framework, Three Spheres of Empathy
- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This advanced video focuses on helping candidates think more strategically and deeply about product sense questions, rather than just going through the motions of the framework. Dianna explains the objective of each section, how it translates to real PM work, and provides advanced techniques for thinking deeply even in unfamiliar problem spaces. Key emphasis is placed on understanding each section as if you're pitching to investors or the CEO, using concrete examples to develop empathy, and creating differentiated solutions through specificity.

## Key Takeaways
1. Think of the "why" section as an investor pitch or pitching to the CEO - you need to excite and educate your audience
2. For user segmentation, start with concrete examples rather than abstract personas, then organize into MECE buckets
3. The more specific your pain point, the more differentiated your solution will be
4. Use the "three spheres of empathy" to develop deep understanding: personal experience, friends/family/media, visualization
5. Prioritize using objective criteria (data-driven) rather than subjective criteria whenever possible
6. Avoid being solution-led - stay problem-led throughout the interview
7. Combine different technologies and trends to create more creative, differentiated solutions

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Strategic Thinking in "Why" Section
- Cover trends, market gaps, and opportunities
- Quantify market size (dollar opportunity, number of people)
- Align to company mission explicitly
- Identify company strengths to leverage
- Explain how it benefits the company (revenue, users, expansion)

### Three Spheres of Empathy
1. **Personal Experience:** Recall when you last did X and think deeply about that process
2. **Secondary Experience:** Think about friends/family who experienced it or media depictions
3. **Visualization:** Put yourself in that experience and ask "what next?" repeatedly

### User Segmentation Techniques
- Start with concrete examples (real personas you've seen)
- Think about opposites and buckets to ensure MECE
- Consider least frequent vs most frequent users
- Use objective criteria for prioritization: TAM, frequency, disposable income, willingness to spend

### Solution Development Strategy
- Leverage company strengths in your solutions
- Combine different technologies and trends (e.g., "AR/VR + social")
- Avoid solutions that already exist in the market

## Sample Questions Covered
- Grocery shopping experience (used as running example)
- Antique buying journey (referenced from another video)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Going through the framework motions without thinking deeply about the problem space
- Being too generic in mission alignment (e.g., "helps people connect" for Facebook)
- Using life stages as segmentation when it doesn't create distinctive needs
- Having pain points that are too shallow or not specific enough
- Being solution-led from the beginning instead of problem-led
- Coming up with solutions that already exist in the market
- Using only subjective criteria for prioritization

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Most candidates will go through the four part framework... but they'll struggle to think deeply in each of the sections so it makes it seem like they're going through the motions"
- "Think about it as an investor pitch or think about this as pitching the CEO of the company that you're interviewing for"
- "The more specific your pain point, the more differentiated your solution will end up being"
- "Use your experiences that you think is generalizable to the population"
- "Combining and remixing is going to ensure that you're going to come up with a more interesting solution than the average population"
- "What you as a product probably want to be known for a gazillion things... here is when you need to do the work of prioritizing"
