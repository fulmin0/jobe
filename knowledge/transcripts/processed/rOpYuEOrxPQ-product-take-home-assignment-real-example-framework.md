- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This video provides a comprehensive framework for tackling PM take-home assignments, which are increasingly common in product interviews. Using Square as a working example, the presenter breaks down a four-part structure: understanding the business, gathering and analyzing data, developing strategy, and planning execution. The framework helps candidates avoid spending excessive time (candidates often have full-time jobs) while demonstrating strategic thinking and execution capability.

## Key Takeaways
1. Take-home projects test your process and logical thinking more than getting the "right answer"
2. Understanding the business (mission, goals, users, business model) is critical but often skipped
3. Data gathering is the trickiest part - find enough to inform decisions without falling into analysis paralysis
4. Don't dig past page 5 on Google - balance data quality with time efficiency
5. User interviews are one of the best data sources - companies often encourage candidates to talk directly to customers
6. Look for 3-5 recurring themes in data, then prioritize based on impact and gaps
7. Strategy means "plan to win" - connect themes to higher mission and show how solutions ladder up
8. Mix practical solutions with moonshot ideas to show breadth of thinking

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Four-Part Take-Home Framework

#### Part 1: Understanding the Business
1. **Mission** - Identify key themes to connect strategy to later
2. **Goals** - North Star metric + 3-5 supporting metrics
3. **Users** - Multi-sided ecosystem players
4. **Business Model** - How does the company make money? How do goals support revenue?
5. **Source:** Public company earnings reports (best source for goals, business model, metrics)

#### Part 2: Data Gathering
**User Research Sources:**
- User interviews (best - talk directly to customers)
- App store reviews (Google Play, Apple Store)
- Forums (Reddit, YouTube review videos)

**Market Research Sources:**
- Statistics (Statista, Pew Research, Google search)
- Industry reports (VCs, McKinsey, BCG, Bain)
- Raw data (public earnings reports)

**Data Analysis Process:**
1. Look for 3-5 recurring themes across sources
2. Screenshot or quote directly from users
3. Prioritize themes using criteria:
   - Is this a gap the company isn't addressing?
   - What's the impact on key goals?
   - Does this create competitive advantage?

#### Part 3: Strategy Development
1. Define strategy addressing prioritized themes
2. Connect strategy to company mission
3. Develop 2-3 solutions per strategic pillar
4. Mix practical and moonshot ideas
5. Prioritize using ROI analysis (effort vs. benefit)
6. Create wireframes showing user flows
7. Turn strategy into month-by-month roadmap

#### Part 4: Execution Planning
1. **Success Metrics** - How do you know if you're winning?
2. **Experiments** - A/B tests for key hypotheses
3. **Go-to-Market Strategy** - Awareness, purchase drivers, brand positioning

## Sample Questions Covered
- Generic take-home format: "Develop a product strategy for [Company X]"
- Square example used throughout for concrete illustration
- Implicit: How would you approach ambiguous, open-ended projects?

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Skipping business understanding and jumping straight to solutions
- Spending weeks on data gathering (falling down rabbit holes)
- Digging past page 5 on Google searches (diminishing returns)
- Worrying too much about "wrong" data rather than showing logical reasoning
- Not prioritizing themes or solutions with clear criteria
- Only showing practical solutions without moonshot thinking (or vice versa)
- Missing the go-to-market component of execution
- Not connecting strategy back to company mission and goals

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "How are you supposed to propose solutions or a strategy if you don't understand the business?"
- "Understanding the business is critical - it's the foundation you build product recommendations on"
- "Nothing beats talking to customers - companies often explicitly want you to interview their customers"
- "Don't dig past page 5 on Google - it's really mentally draining and diminishing returns"
- "They don't care about the right answer as much as your process - if you build logical conclusions throughout, that shows you can execute if given the right data"
- "Strategy plain and simple means a plan of attack, a plan on how to win"
- "Mix practical solutions and moonshot ideas - Google looks for moonshots, Facebook looks for practical people problems"
- "Go-to-market is such a key component of launching successful products - don't skip it"
- On data quality: "If data is maybe wrong, it matters less than how you built upon that data with logical conclusions"

## Specific Framework Components

### Business Understanding Template (Square Example)
- **Mission:** Enable sellers to participate and thrive in the economy (themes: enablement, sellers, economic participation)
- **Goals:** Number of businesses signed up, total subscription revenue
- **Users:** Sellers (businesses using Square), buyers (customers purchasing through Square)
- **Business Model:** Subscription fees, transaction fees on payments
- **Source:** Square earnings reports

### Data Categorization
**User Research:**
- Primary (interviews)
- Secondary (reviews, forums)

**Market Research:**
- Stats databases
- Industry reports
- Raw data (earnings)

### Strategy → Roadmap Connection
1. Strategy addresses 3-5 prioritized themes
2. Each strategic pillar has 2-3 solution ideas
3. Solutions prioritized by ROI
4. Wireframes show key user flows
5. Month-by-month roadmap sequences execution
6. Success metrics, experiments, GTM plan complete picture

## Advanced Tips
- For B2B products, companies may explicitly ask you to interview customers
- Connect strategy back to mission themes identified at the start
- ROI analysis: effort to build vs. benefit on key goals
- Different companies value different solution types (Google = moonshots, Facebook = practical)
- Go-to-market covers: awareness, purchase drivers, brand positioning
- Execution shows you can "get things done" beyond just strategizing
