- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOwkN1gQfsk
- **Channel:** Dianna Yau
- **Duration:** 22:01
- **Question Types:** product-sense
- **Frameworks Covered:** Product Sense Framework (4-part), Mission Alignment Assessment
- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This mock interview demonstrates how to handle a challenging product sense question in an unfamiliar space (antiques) that doesn't align well with the company's mission (Facebook/Meta). Dianna walks through "build a product to help people buy antiques" and makes the strategic decision to recommend NOT building it for Facebook, instead positioning it as a standalone startup. This showcases the importance of honest mission alignment assessment and demonstrates deep thinking in an obscure, unfamiliar product space.

## Key Takeaways
1. It's perfectly acceptable (and often impressive) to conclude that a product doesn't fit within the company's ecosystem
2. When faced with an unfamiliar space, use visualization and imagination to develop empathy and pain points
3. Clarifying the scope of a broad topic (antiques: expensive vs. cheap, big vs. small items) is crucial upfront
4. Assess mission alignment honestly - don't force-fit something just because the interviewer is from that company
5. A three-pronged strategy helps organize your solution approach: supply, experience quality, and discovery
6. Tackling multiple pain points with solutions (rather than just one) shows breadth of creative thinking
7. Even without personal experience, you can develop strong pain points through logical user journey mapping

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Mission Alignment Assessment
- Evaluate trends supporting the space
- Assess market size (niche vs. mass market)
- Determine alignment strength to company mission
- Consider company strengths and how they apply
- Assess business benefit (engagement, revenue, new users)
- Make honest recommendation: build for company X or as standalone

### Three-Pronged Strategy for Antiques
1. **Drive more supply:** Partner with sellers, create incentives to list
2. **Ensure positive experiences:** Help organizers design great tours/products
3. **Improve discovery:** Better matching and recommendation systems

### Solution Categories Demonstrated
- **Operational solutions:** Partner with boutiques, hire photographers
- **Product/feature solutions:** ML visual recognition, 360-degree videos, appraisal tools
- **Marketing solutions:** Insert ads in collector communities
- **Trust/safety solutions:** Escrow funds, address verification, return policies

## Sample Questions Covered
- "Build a product to help people buy antiques" (full walkthrough)
- Strategic assessment: Does this fit Facebook's mission?

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Force-fitting a product into a company's ecosystem when it doesn't align
- Not clarifying broad or ambiguous scopes at the beginning
- Being too intimidated by unfamiliar spaces to develop strong opinions
- Shallow mission alignment (e.g., "antiques help collectors connect, so it fits Facebook")
- Only tackling one pain point when you could address multiple
- Not developing a clear strategy for how you'll win in the market

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "I'm asking myself, how would investing in the antique buying space benefit the company? If it's not benefiting the company in some way, why would the company build it?"
- "From this analysis, there's not a huge market size... semi-aligned with the mission, sort of, but probably not the strongest use case. Hence, I'm going to recommend that we do not build this for Facebook"
- "I have never bought an antique... It's hard for me to empathize with this space, but I'm going to imagine myself as someone who needed to go hunt down a vase from the Ming Dynasty"
- "The first thing is truthfully assessing does this fit within the Facebook product ecosystem and not just force fitting it into it just because the question is from an interviewer from that company"
- "My solutions actually solve the problem - people take that for granted but it's important"
- "Challenging yourself to think in odd, unrelatable spaces - this challenge actually makes you stronger in product sense questions"
