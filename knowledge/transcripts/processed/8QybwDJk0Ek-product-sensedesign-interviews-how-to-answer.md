## Summary
This foundational video provides a complete introduction to product sense interviews, explaining why companies ask these intentionally ambiguous questions and what skills they're assessing. The host breaks down a four-part framework and maps it to five key skills being evaluated: information gathering, structured thinking, prioritization, user empathy, and creative brainstorming. This is an excellent starting point for understanding the overall approach to product design questions.

## Key Takeaways
1. Product sense questions are intentionally ambiguous to test how you navigate toward strategy
2. There are no "right" answers, but there are definitely bad answers
3. Using a standard framework is expected and acceptable - differentiation comes from how you use it
4. Senior-level experience doesn't guarantee success - college students can excel with proper practice
5. The five key skills can be practiced independently before bringing them together
6. Structured thinking means organizing thoughts in mutually exclusive buckets, not rambling
7. Granular pain points inspire more unique solutions than high-level needs

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### 4-Part Product Sense Framework
1. **Mission & Market Landscape:** What's happening in the space? How does it tie to company mission?
2. **Target Users:** Who should we build for and prioritize?
3. **User Journeys & Pain Points:** What existing experiences suck for these users?
4. **Creative Solutions:** How can we solve these problems?

### 5 Key Skills Being Assessed
1. **Information Gathering:** Bringing together right data (market trends, competitors, company strengths/mission)
2. **Structure:** Organizing thoughts in structured way (top categories → sub-categories)
3. **Prioritization:** Showing ability to focus on most impactful things using objective criteria
4. **User Empathy:** Internalizing user pains and frustrations at granular level
5. **Brainstorming:** Coming up with creative solutions that may not exist today

### Application Example (Facebook Travel Product)
**Information Gathering:**
- Opportunities: Research, booking, transportation, accommodation, local experiences
- Trends: Transportation/accommodation commoditized; demand for unique local experiences
- Company: Facebook's mission is community, strengths include social sharing, user-generated content, discovery

**Structured Thinking:**
- Bad: Budget travelers, business travelers, teens (overlapping)
- Good: Leisure (explorers, tourists, resortists) vs Business (mutually exclusive)

**Prioritization:**
- Criteria: Size of population, underserved market, frequency of use
- Score each segment as low/medium/high, explain reasoning

**User Empathy:**
- Journey: Getting inspiration → Research → Deciding between places → Aligning with friends/family → Creating itinerary
- Pain points: Research takes hours across multiple sources, indecision/analysis paralysis, tedious alignment with travel companions, puzzle-piece itinerary creation

**Brainstorming:**
- Granular pain point ("needing details on local places") beats generic pain point ("needing to do research")
- Solutions: Pinterest-style board for friend contributions, crowdsourced itinerary publishing, professional local guide marketplace

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a fire alarm for the deaf (Google)
- Design a product to improve gas stations (Google)
- Design alarm clock for blind people (Google)
- Build a product in the travel category for Facebook (detailed example)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Worrying that using a standard framework will be penalized (it won't - execution matters)
- Thinking product sense questions require years of PM experience
- Using demographic segmentation instead of creating mutually exclusive behavioral buckets
- Coming up with high-level needs instead of granular, emotionally-charged pain points
- Generic pain points leading to generic solutions

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "The product design questions are intentionally ambiguous to see how you navigate towards a strategy and a product"
- "There are no right answers to these questions. Many of us as interviewers are not looking for one answer we already have in mind, but there definitely are bad answers"
- "We're not expecting you to come up with a novel framework. We're trying to understand how you use that framework to navigate ambiguity, to have structured thinking, and ultimately be able to back up your decisions with compelling persuasive arguments"
- "I've seen folks from very senior levels even struggle with these type of questions, and I've seen people in college that are able to nail these questions. So don't worry, no matter what level you're at with the right type of practice, you'll be able to get better"
- "To hear a key skill you want to nail down is to be able to map the user journey at every point of the experience and then identify in each of these themes what are the things that sucked"
- "I've seen that the more granular you can come up with the pain points, the more unique your solutions naturally end up becoming"
- "In sports you drill to get better - I also recommend here to drill each of these five skills to optimize how you perform in each skill and then bring it together"
