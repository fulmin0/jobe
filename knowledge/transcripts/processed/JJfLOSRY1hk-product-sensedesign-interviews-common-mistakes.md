## Summary
This comprehensive video compiles all the common mistakes candidates make during product sense interviews, organized by each section of the framework. The host provides specific examples of what weak answers sound like versus strong answers, helping candidates recognize pitfalls in their own preparation. The video emphasizes that mistakes make candidates appear scripted, question-dependent, hand-holding-needy, or subjective rather than data-driven.

## Key Takeaways
1. Always share your structure upfront so interviewers can guide you if needed
2. Don't ask clarifying questions that won't impact your answer (mobile vs desktop)
3. Some questions you should figure out yourself, not ask (which market, business objective)
4. Never assume you should build for the interviewing company - always assess strategically
5. Avoid generic responses about mission alignment that could apply to any space
6. Segment by behavior, not demographics, and ensure segments are MECE
7. Come up with pain points, not just needs - show what specifically sucks

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Complete Product Sense Framework (4 Parts)
1. **Motivation:** Why should we build this?
2. **User Segmentation:** Who should we build for?
3. **Pain Points:** What problems are users struggling with?
4. **Solutions:** How do we solve these problems creatively?

### Common Mistake Categories
Candidates who make these mistakes appear:
- Not thinking during interview (reading from script)
- Asking too many questions (not driving conversation)
- Requiring too much prompting/handholding (not showing leadership)
- Making subjective vs objective decisions (not data-driven)

### Section-by-Section Mistake Breakdown

**Clarifying Questions Mistakes:**
- Bad: "Should this be mobile or desktop?" "Is there a time constraint?"
- Bad: "Which market should we build for?" "What's the business objective?" "Should we build for Company X?"
- Good: "I know X companies are already building similar products. Should I consider that?" "Should we consider pre/during/post-COVID?"

**Structure Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to share structure upfront
- Over-scoping by adding metrics section (tested in separate interview)

**Motivation Mistakes:**
- Bad: "I'm just going to assume we're Google building this"
- Bad: "Facebook's mission is to connect people... we're connecting grocery stores and people shopping"
- Good: Strategic assessment using mission alignment, competitive strengths, market opportunity, competitive advantages

**User Segmentation Mistakes:**
- Bad: Not being broad enough OR too granular (business travelers, pet travelers, leisure travelers)
- Bad: Subjective prioritization ("business travelers have the most needs")
- Bad: Not MECE (mothers who travel + people who travel with kids = overlap)
- Good: Broad to granular progression (travelers → leisure vs business → sub-segments)
- Good: Objective criteria (population size, frequency, willingness to spend)

**Pain Points Mistakes:**
- Bad: Coming up with needs instead of pain points ("deciding what place to go to, organizing trip, coordinating")
- Bad: Not using objective criteria to prioritize ("it's the first step in the journey")
- Good: Specific pain points with emotional depth ("not having enough information... fragmented... hard to compare")
- Good: Objective criteria (affects largest population, no existing solutions)

**Solutions Mistakes:**
- Bad: Using technologies shallowly ("use VR and AR to help decide where to go")
- Bad: Proposing solutions that already exist without acknowledging them
- Good: Deep technology integration ("VR/AR experience to put users in multiple places simultaneously to feel pyramids vs rainforests")
- Good: Acknowledge existing solutions, then build innovative layer on top

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a product to help people find doctors
- Build a product to improve the grocery store experience (for Facebook)
- Build something in the travel space

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
### Clarifying Questions
- Asking questions that don't matter (mobile vs desktop, time constraints)
- Asking questions you should figure out yourself (market, business objective, whether to build for interviewing company)

### Motivation
- Assuming you should build for interviewing company without strategic assessment
- Generic mission alignment responses ("connecting X and Y")

### User Segmentation
- Segmenting by demographics vs behavior
- Not being MECE (overlapping groups)
- Subjective prioritization without objective criteria
- Being too broad or too granular

### Pain Points
- Identifying needs instead of specific pain points
- Not using objective criteria for prioritization
- Lacking emotional depth and user empathy

### Solutions
- Using technology buzzwords without substance
- Proposing solutions that already exist
- Not acknowledging existing players in the market

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "A lot of the times when candidates do the things that I'm going to be talking about, they come off: 1) Not sounding as if they're actually thinking during the interview, but rather reading off of the script. 2) Asking too many questions that make me think that they're not doing enough to drive the conversation. 3) Requiring too much prompting and nudging. 4) Making decisions that seem really subjective versus objective and data driven"
- "Take this opportunity to actually strategically assess whether the company that you're interviewing for should be building about the space they're asking you about"
- "I literally could have given the candidate any space and they would have just said yes it's aligned with the mission because I'm connecting the demand side and supply side"
- "Think of this as an investment pitch and the investment pitch first starts off with why do we care about building in this space and if you come up with something generic and weak the investors not going to let you go on with the rest of the presentation"
- "Me as an interviewer I might think leisure travelers have the most need. So what would help is a more objective criteria"
- "You really want to use those general needs and think about what sucks in each of these parts"
- "Your solution basically leverages the strengths of VR AR and defines what the experience would actually be like for the user so that the interviewer actually gets excited about the solution"
