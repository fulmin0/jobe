## Summary
This video focuses on the first critical section of product sense interviews: establishing WHY a product should be built. The host presents a three-part framework for answering motivation questions, emphasizing strategic thinking and avoiding the common mistake of rushing into solutions. The framework includes analyzing market trends, identifying opportunities aligned with company mission, and assessing company strengths/weaknesses in the space.

## Key Takeaways
1. Most candidates fail to adequately address "why should we build this?" before jumping into solutions
2. Strategic thinking in the opening phase is critical to demonstrating product leadership
3. Understanding existing ecosystem players prevents proposing solutions that already exist
4. Always ask whether you should build for the interviewing company - never assume
5. Leverage company strengths when evaluating opportunity spaces
6. Spend approximately 5 minutes on the motivation section of product sense interviews
7. The "why" section sets up the entire interview - weak justification undermines everything that follows

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Motivation Framework (3-Part Structure)
- **Part 1 - Trends:** Identify broad trends in the space and existing ecosystem players
- **Part 2 - Opportunities:** Explain why building in this space is important and how it aligns with company mission (total addressable market, revenue potential, mission alignment)
- **Part 3 - Strengths & Weaknesses:** Assess what competitive advantages or disadvantages the company has in this space

### Application Example (Design a Product for Finding Doctors)
- Trend: Healthcare digitization, AI for illness detection, consumer platforms like ZocDoc
- Opportunities: Everyone needs doctors (huge TAM), healthcare is costly (revenue potential), improve healthcare transparency
- Facebook Strengths: Doctors/hospitals already on platform, large user base for crowdsourcing, powerful AI for personalization
- Facebook Weaknesses: No existing health data, trust issues with health data storage

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a product to help people find doctors (used as example throughout)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Rushing through the "why should we build this" section without adequate strategic analysis
- Neglecting to research existing players in the ecosystem before identifying pain points
- Giving the impression you're already solutioning during the trends discussion
- Assuming you should build for the company you're interviewing for (always ask to clarify)
- Not being specific about why the opportunity aligns with company mission

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Most candidates rush through one of the most important parts of the question and fail to show strategic thinking, which is addressing why should we even build this product"
- "Companies want to hire product leaders who are well rounded with knowledge on various topics and can talk intelligently about various topics, especially technologies"
- "A common mistake that people will make here is neglecting the existing players in the ecosystem... they end up brainstorming solutions that already exist"
- "Never assume here. Always ask" (regarding whether to build for the interviewing company)
- "Spend the first five minutes of your product sense interview questions answering why should we build this"
