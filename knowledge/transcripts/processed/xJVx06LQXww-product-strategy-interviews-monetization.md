## Summary
This video tackles monetization strategy questions using WhatsApp as an example. The presenter covers a four-part framework for approaching "how would you monetize X?" questions, provides a comprehensive overview of six common monetization models, and develops four specific solutions for WhatsApp. The video emphasizes that messaging apps are particularly challenging to monetize due to commoditization and intimacy of the medium, making this an excellent case study for difficult monetization scenarios.

## Key Takeaways
1. Messaging apps are uniquely difficult to monetize because they're commoditized (users won't pay) and intimate (hard to inject commercial activity like ads)
2. Most successful businesses mix and match multiple monetization models to diversify revenue streams
3. When designing monetization, tread carefully to avoid alienating users - balance business goals with user experience
4. Draw inspiration from how other products monetize, especially international products like WeChat that have cracked difficult monetization challenges
5. Understand both user needs AND business goals to select monetization models that align with both
6. Prioritize solutions based on ROI - effort to build versus potential revenue opportunity
7. Transaction fees work well when you can facilitate end-to-end transactions on the platform

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Four-Part Monetization Framework
1. **Understand the product** - What it does, how it works, key features, challenges
2. **Who are the users and what do they need?** - Consumer vs. business users, distinct goals
3. **Monetization models** - Cover relevant subset that fits the product
4. **Solutions** - Develop specific features that implement chosen models

### Six Common Monetization Models
1. **Subscription** - Netflix, Amazon Prime, phone bills, Cat Lady Box
2. **Freemium** - Spotify (free with ads, paid for premium features)
3. **Ads** - Google, Facebook, Forbes, radio ads (good for high-traffic entertainment/media)
4. **Transaction Fees** - Airbnb, DoorDash (charge both sides of marketplace)
5. **Selling Physical/Digital Goods or Services** - YouTube stickers, consulting packages
6. **Licensing** - Oracle, Salesforce (enterprise model, pay per user seat)

### WhatsApp User Segments
