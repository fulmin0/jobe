- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU635pDoxy4
- **Channel:** Dianna Yau
- **Duration:** 39:25
- **Question Types:** product-sense
- **Frameworks Covered:** ecosystem thinking (supply/demand), behavioral segmentation, user journey mapping, impact vs. effort prioritization
- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This mock interview features Austin, a PM at Meta (formerly Apple, Niantic), tackling "Build a parking solution for Google Maps." The interview showcases highly creative thinking by identifying an unconventional user segment (private parking spot owners), understanding the marketplace dynamics, and proposing innovative solutions combining software and hardware. Austin demonstrates how to generate novel solutions through deep ecosystem analysis, behavioral-based segmentation, and creative brainstorming while maintaining structure throughout.

## Key Takeaways
1. Understand Google Maps' existing strengths (data, user base, GPS, AI capabilities) before proposing solutions
2. Consider both sides of marketplace ecosystems - need healthy supply to serve demand
3. Behavioral segmentation (frequency of spot availability) reveals unique user segments like private spot owners
4. Creative solutions come from identifying underserved segments that existing products miss
5. Mix practical MVP solutions with ambitious hardware plays to show range of thinking
6. User journey for supply side is as important as demand side in marketplace products
7. Building trust (through photos, reviews, ratings) is critical for new marketplace experiences

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Understanding Google Maps Strengths
- Large user base with GPS location data
- Business reviews and ratings
- Integration with Google AI/LLM capabilities
- Existing parking garage listings (limited)

### Ecosystem Analysis (Supply & Demand)

#### Supply Side: Parking Space Providers
Segmented by frequency of availability:
1. **Public street spots** (government-owned) - XL reach, XL frequency, S underserved (already abundant)
2. Private malls - S reach (1-2 per city)
3. Private parking lots (businesses)
4. **Spot owners** (apartment/condo owners) - L reach, M frequency, XL underserved [PRIORITIZED]
5. Restaurants with extra spots

#### Demand Side: Drivers Looking to Park
Segmented by urgency/duration:
1. **Short-term/last-minute** - High urgency (dinner, shopping, client meetings) [PRIORITIZED]
2. Long-term - Switching jobs, need annual parking
3. Medium-term - Renters needing 1-2 year parking

### Prioritization Criteria
- **Reach** - Market size / number of users
- **Frequency of use** - How often the need/supply occurs
- **Underserved users** - Existing solution gaps

### Spot Owner User Journey & Pain Points
1. Leave for work/vacation → Notice unutilized spots
2. **Awareness/uncertainty** - Can I monetize this? (HIGH pain, LARGE no existing solution)
3. Share and promote empty spots - Set up pricing
4. Access and monitoring - **Trust issues** (HIGH pain, LARGE no existing solution)
5. **Payment handling** - Uncertainty about process (HIGH pain, MEDIUM existing solutions)
6. Get spots back - **Ensure availability** (HIGH pain, LARGE no existing solution)
7. Collect reviews - Build recurring customer base

## Sample Questions Covered
- "You're a PM at Google Maps thinking about building a parking solution - what might you build and why?"
- Implicit: Who are all the users? What's the ecosystem? Which problems matter most?

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Not considering supply side in marketplace products (only focusing on demand)
- Generic user segmentation (demographics) vs. behavioral (frequency, motivation)
- Framing needs instead of pain points ("desire to reach more people" vs. "struggle to advertise")
- Not providing strong rationale when prioritizing (just stating "medium" without explaining)
- Being closed to being proven wrong during prioritization discussions
- Thinking features instead of experiences when designing solutions

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "We need a healthy ecosystem for this to work - if you have healthy supply, demand can find spots"
- "I would focus a little bit more on supply side to jumpstart this ecosystem"
- "When I think about user segmentation, I think about behavior or motivation - frequency helps me create a mental model from least to most frequent"
- "On the pain point side, if you can truly empathize to pain and frustration, that's when it really clicks and motivates you to solve it"
- "For prioritization, be open to being proven wrong - this is where the interviewer interjects the most"
- Austin's tip: "Watch Diana's videos, type down notes in detail, dump them into ChatGPT section by section, and prompt it to create frameworks that guide you through interviews"

## Solutions Proposed

### Solution 1: Google Maps Parking Indication (PRIORITIZED)
**Supply Side Setup Flow:**
- Spot owner indicates parking spot available
- Enter XYZ dimensions, max height
- Set pricing (or let Google suggest based on area data)
- Payment info (bank account)
- Availability schedule (e.g., Mon-Fri 9am-5pm)
- Access codes (QR code generation for garages)

**Demand Side Flow:**
- Switch Google Maps view to show parking spots
- See pricing, dimensions, availability
- Book spot with payment via Google Pay

**Trust Building:**
- Take photos (spot owner shows clean spot, driver shows license plate + car)
- Photo when leaving (driver proves no damage)
- Disputes handled through photo evidence + apartment security cameras
- License plate tied to payment (penalty for damage)

**MVP vs. Long-term:**
- MVP: Photo-based using phones
- Long-term: Google Nest cameras for automated detection, NFC sensors, license plate recognition

### Solution 2: Heat Map
- Show supply/demand density by area
- Help match drivers seeking spots with owners renting
- Build rating/trust profiles for spot owners (like business reviews)
- Highlight highly trusted parking areas
- Small impact but low effort (maps infrastructure exists)

### Solution 3: Hardware Play
- Google Nest cameras detect empty spots and license plates
- Address trust issues automatically
- Charge penalties for damage/overstaying
- Blue sky: New IoT gadgets (proximity sensors, NFC payment)
- Even more ambitious: Motorized platforms in garages maximizing space, managing entry/payment
- High effort, requires R&D and hardware development

## Interview Strengths (Debrief Notes)
1. **Novel solution** - Private spot owner economy applying sharing economy to parking
2. **Mix of practical and moonshot** - MVP (photos) → cameras → motorized platforms
3. **Unique user segment** - Spot owners segment led to differentiated solution
4. **Clear structure** - Signposted each section, stated criteria before prioritizing
5. **User empathy** - Personal anecdotes (San Francisco $500/month for garage)

## Opportunities for Improvement
1. **Pain points vs. needs** - Some phrased as needs ("desire to reach people") vs. obstacles ("I struggle to advertise my spot because...")
2. **Prioritization rationale** - Walk through why "medium" vs. "large" with concrete examples
3. **Existing solutions** - Be careful claiming "no existing solution" - interviewer may know competitors

## Advanced Tactics Demonstrated
- Behavioral segmentation over demographic
- Supply-side focus in marketplace
- Trust as central product challenge
- Progressive solution evolution (photos → cameras → hardware)
- Using ChatGPT to synthesize learnings from interview prep videos
