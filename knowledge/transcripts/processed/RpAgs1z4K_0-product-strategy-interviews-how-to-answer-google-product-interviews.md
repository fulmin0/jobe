- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This video teaches how to answer high-level product strategy questions like "What should Company X build next?" or "You're the CEO of Company Y - what's your 5-year roadmap?" These questions test big-picture, long-term thinking and are distinct from product sense questions. The three-part framework covers understanding the company (mission, investments, strengths, goals), analyzing ecosystem opportunities (users, trends, competitors), and developing execution plans (narrative, roadmap, risks).

## Key Takeaways
1. Strategy questions test CEO-level thinking about big-picture, long-term direction
2. Companies want PMs who can think ambitiously about next big ideas (mobile, metaverse, cloud, AI/AR/VR)
3. Innovation can come from new technologies OR novel applications of existing technologies
4. Start by deeply understanding company mission, current investments, and core strengths
5. Identify 3-5 opportunity areas, then prioritize based on criteria aligned with company goals
6. Strong execution section includes strategic narrative (investor pitch), 2-5 year roadmap with milestones, immediate next steps, and risk mitigation
7. This framework differs from "Should Company X acquire Company Y?" questions (separate video needed)

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
