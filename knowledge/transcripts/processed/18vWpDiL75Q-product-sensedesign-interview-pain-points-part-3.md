- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18vWpDiL75Q
- **Channel:** Dianna Yau
- **Duration:** 13:26
- **Question Types:** product-sense
- **Frameworks Covered:** User Journey Mapping, Pain Point Identification, Prioritization Matrix
- **Difficulty Level:** intermediate

## Summary
This comprehensive video teaches how to identify and prioritize user pain points through a three-step process: creating detailed user journeys, identifying frustrating/suboptimal experiences, and using data-driven criteria to prioritize which pain points to solve. The video emphasizes the importance of using concrete personal experiences, breaking down steps granularly, and showing genuine emotional empathy with user frustrations to inspire creative solutions.

## Key Takeaways
1. User empathy demonstrated through pain points is a key assessment criterion in product sense interviews
2. Start with your most recent concrete personal experience, not hypothetical scenarios
3. Break down the user journey into granular steps - specificity reveals more pain points
4. Don't ignore existing solutions - include them in your journey mapping
5. Identify both frustrating/annoying experiences AND suboptimal/inefficient ones
6. Emotional connection to pain points drives better solution brainstorming
7. Prioritize pain points using objective criteria (# people affected, severity, existing solutions) not gut feelings

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Pain Point Framework (3-Part Process)
- **Step 1 - Create User Journey:** Map the existing experience step-by-step using concrete personal examples
- **Step 2 - Identify Pain Points:** Flag experiences that are frustrating, annoying, maddening, or suboptimal/inefficient
- **Step 3 - Prioritize Pain Points:** Use data-driven criteria to select which pain point(s) to solve

### User Journey Mapping Tips
- Start with most recent personal experience
- Make it concrete, not hypothetical
- Break down into specific steps
- Include existing solutions in the journey
- Get as granular as possible

### Prioritization Criteria Examples
- How many people experience this pain point?
- How painful/severe is it? (motivates action)
- How many existing solutions already address it?

### Application Example (Finding Specialty Doctors)
**User Journey:**
1. Identifying need for specialty doctor (referral from physician or self-requested)
2. Finding doctors (physician referral, ZocDoc, Google)
3. Deciding on doctor (check insurance, proximity, availability)
4. Requesting appointment (calling office, using ZocDoc)

**Pain Points Identified:**
- Limited options/supply of specialty doctors
- Having to use multiple platforms to find doctors
- Lack of complete information (insurance, availability, cost)
- Frustrating phone tag with doctor's offices
- No transparency on costs until after visit

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a product to help people find doctors (continuing example, focus on specialty doctors segment)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Picking pain point first, then rationalizing why (instead of systematic evaluation)
- Not explaining why you chose a pain point before moving on
- Not being specific enough in the user journey (missing opportunities for pain points)
- Ignoring existing solutions like ZocDoc when mapping current experience
- Using subjective criteria instead of objective data-driven prioritization
- Failing to show emotional connection to user frustrations

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Deeply understanding user pain points is essential for brainstorming really creative solutions"
- "A key tip here is to make sure you don't ignore existing solutions and to add it into the current experience"
- "Break down and get as specific as you can. Because the more specific you get, the more you can empathize with the user. And the more opportunities you'll get to find really interesting pain points"
- "The part about identifying experiences that were frustrating is exactly how you empathize with the user. And that part is especially powerful because I can remember when I felt emotionally charged at some frustrating experiences"
- "Oh, just thinking about it, I am a steaming. And that's how you want to feel when you come up with pain points"
- "What's most important in these interviews isn't just to get the right answer, but is to explain and convey and convince your interviewer that the answer you chose is something that they can get on board with"
- "You can prioritize multiple pain points. If you're building an MVP, it's going to be hard to build a product that allows you to search if there's no directory"
