## Summary
This focused video provides three actionable techniques for brainstorming creative and standout solutions during product sense interviews. The key insight is that specific, novel pain points naturally lead to more creative solutions. The techniques include identifying unique pain points, applying emerging technologies/trends to the problem space, and borrowing proven approaches from other verticals.

## Key Takeaways
1. Specific, unique pain points lead to more creative solutions than generic ones
2. Generic pain points often lead to solutions that already exist (e.g., ZocDoc)
3. Apply technologies (AI, AR, VR, crypto) and trends (short-form video, influencer marketing) to novel use cases
4. Don't use technology jargon without understanding it - use trends instead if uncertain
5. Borrow from other verticals solving similar problems (Tinder for discovery, e-commerce for filtering)
6. The more granular your pain point, the higher chance your solution is innovative
7. Avoid proposing solutions that already exist in the market

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Creative Solution Brainstorming (3 Techniques)

**Technique 1 - Identify Specific Pain Points**
- Generic pain point: "No central directory for doctors" → Generic solution: "Build a searchable platform" (already exists: ZocDoc)
- Specific pain point: "People struggle to make informed decisions because they don't know which criteria optimize for best outcomes" → More creative solutions possible

**Technique 2 - Use Trends and Technologies**
- Technologies: AI, VR, AR, crypto
- Trends: Short-form video (TikTok), influencer marketing (YouTube)
- Example: Use AI to personalize recommendations by learning from past good/bad doctor experiences
- Warning: Don't throw around jargon without understanding it

**Technique 3 - Borrow from Other Verticals**
- Ask: "How are other verticals helping people find things?"
- Tinder example: Random options + like/dislike learning algorithm
- E-commerce example: Extensive filters to narrow down options
- Cross-pollinate proven approaches to your problem space

### Application Example (Finding Doctors)
- Generic approach: Directory with search/filters (copies ZocDoc)
- Better pain point: Lack of criteria knowledge for making informed decisions
- Technology application: AI personalization based on past experiences
- Vertical borrowing: Tinder-style discovery, e-commerce filtering

## Sample Questions Covered
- Design a product to help people find doctors (continuing series example)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Coming up with generic pain points that lead to existing solutions
- Falling into the trap of replicating ZocDoc or other obvious platforms
- Using technology buzzwords (AI, VR, AR) without explaining how they add value
- Not checking if your solution already exists in the market
- Failing to make pain points specific enough to inspire unique solutions

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Most candidates will use the pain point: there's no central directory for all the doctors for people to search and discover. And as a result, most candidates will say, well, let's just build a platform where it houses all doctors and allows people to search using filters. This isn't wrong and it's actually very practical. The problem is it already exists. It's called ZocDoc"
- "How many times have you fallen into a trap like that?"
- "The best way to avoid falling into this trap is just avoiding generic pain points entirely"
- "Applying technologies like AI, VR, AR, crypto... or even trends like short form video, aka TikTok, or influencer marketing... applying these novel technologies and trends to new use cases can really help you come up with a standout solution"
- "A common mistake people make here and trip up on is they end up throwing around these jargon words without really understanding them. And if you're not comfortable with the technology, feel free to use trends instead"
- "Feel free to take inspiration from other verticals and how they're tackling the problem you're trying to tackle"
