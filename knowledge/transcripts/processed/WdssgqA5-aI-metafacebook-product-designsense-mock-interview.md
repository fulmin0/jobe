- **Question Types:** product-sense
- **Frameworks Covered:** Product Sense Framework (4-part), Prioritization Matrix, Impact vs Effort
- **Difficulty Level:** intermediate

## Summary
This is a full mock interview featuring Trish, who recently received an offer from Meta. The question is "What product would you build to help people become more fit?" for Facebook/Meta. Trish demonstrates strong energy, clear prioritization with matrices, and solid strategic thinking around fitness communities. The interview includes Diana's real-time feedback, highlighting what worked well (clear prioritization, deep pain points, energy) and areas for improvement (more detail on goal-setting mechanisms). This is an excellent example of a complete product sense interview from start to finish.

## Key Takeaways
1. Strong energy and enthusiasm throughout the interview makes a huge difference in perception
2. Always connect back to company mission and explain business benefit, not just user value
3. Use visual matrices to show prioritization logic clearly (makes it easy for interviewer to follow)
4. When identifying pain points specific to your target segment, explicitly call out why they don't apply to other segments
5. Recording yourself practicing helps identify rambling and improve conciseness
6. Medium-motivation users (not beginners, not experts) are often the sweet spot for fitness products
7. Fitness communities have become increasingly important post-COVID and align well with Meta's mission

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### User Segmentation Approach
- **Creators:** Influencers, personal trainers using social media
- **Third parties:** Gyms, studios, classes
- **End users:** Further segmented by motivation level
  - Low motivation: Not interested, don't know where to start
  - Medium motivation: Some workouts weekly, not in routine (PRIORITIZED)
  - High motivation: Experts with established routines

### Prioritization Matrix Used
- **Criteria for user segments:** Reach, impact (based on position/mission), underserved audience
- **Criteria for pain points:** Reach, painfulness, existing solutions
- **Criteria for solutions:** Novelty, impact/reach, effort

### Pain Points Identified
1. Lack of time (applies to all segments)
2. Lack of accountability and support (specific to medium motivation)
3. Lack of education/not knowing what to do (specific to medium motivation)
4. Lonely process (applies broadly)
5. Lack of understanding how to set goals (specific to medium motivation)

## Sample Questions Covered
- "What product would you build to help people become more fit?" (Meta/Facebook)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Not explaining how the product benefits the business, only focusing on user value
- Not being specific enough about the mechanism for solving pain points (e.g., how does goal-setting actually work?)
- Tendency to go off on tangents - recording yourself helps catch this
- Coming up with only 1-2 solutions instead of 3-5 options
- Not clearly differentiating which pain points are specific to your target segment vs. universal

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Community and fitness kind of go hand in hand and this has become something that has really changed the game in fitness"
- "There is one risk here that I really want to bring to our attention - this is a pretty saturated market... we're going to want to create something differentiated"
- "I think there's no such thing as too much practice, but it's quality of practice over quantity... recording myself was really helpful because I wanted to see if I was going off on tangents"
- "Don't get overwhelmed or discouraged... just take a deep breath, take a step back, and take it one at a time... give yourself at least a month, probably a couple of months to prepare"
- "When you do get an offer, know that you can always move up from a preliminary offer... you shouldn't just take the first thing"
- Feedback from Diana: "Everything you said really resonated... what was especially strong was that you went deep in explaining them [pain points]... we all know we've been there"
