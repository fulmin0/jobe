- **Duration:** 15:33
- **Question Types:** product-sense
- **Frameworks Covered:** Product Sense Framework (4-part), Time Management Framework
- **Difficulty Level:** intermediate

## Summary
Dianna Yau tackles one of the biggest struggles in product sense interviews: managing time effectively within the standard 45-minute window. She breaks down exactly how much time to allocate to each section (intro, why, user segments, pain points, solutions) and provides specific strategies for saving time without sacrificing quality. The video emphasizes that mastering the content comes first, then optimizing for speed. She recommends aiming for 30 minutes of actual talking time after accounting for intros, outros, and interviewer questions.

## Key Takeaways
1. Aim to complete your product sense answer in 30 minutes of actual talking time (out of 45 minutes total)
2. Intro/clarification should take no more than 3 minutes total
3. The "why build this" section should take about 5 minutes (2 min landscape, 1 min mission alignment)
4. User segments should take 5 minutes (3 min for segmentation, 2 min for prioritization)
5. Pain points deserve the most time at 10 minutes (2-3 min user journey, 5 min pain points, 2-3 min prioritization)
6. Solutions should take 7 minutes (5 min generating solutions, 2 min prioritizing)
7. Save time by avoiding generic clarifying questions, not being overly exhaustive, and focusing on the 80% instead of 100%

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### Time Allocation Framework
- **Total interview time:** 45 minutes
- **Minus intro/outro/questions:** 30 minutes of actual answer time
- **Intro/clarifications:** 3 minutes
- **Why section:** 5 minutes
- **User segments:** 5 minutes
- **Pain points:** 10 minutes
- **Solutions:** 7 minutes

### Time-Saving Techniques
- Avoid generic questions that won't influence your answer
- Make explicit assumptions instead of asking basic questions
- Don't be 100% exhaustive - focus on 80% of segments/pain points
- Don't explain why you didn't choose other options (do it silently)
- Use bullet points for notes, not full sentences
- Think for 1-2 minutes before speaking to avoid rambling

## Sample Questions Covered
- "Build a product to improve the grocery store experience" (used as running example)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Wasting time on generic clarifying questions that don't add value
- Trying to be 100% exhaustive instead of focusing on the most important 80%
- Spending too much time explaining why you didn't choose other options
- Rambling or thinking out loud instead of structuring thoughts first
- Writing out full sentences as notes instead of bullet points
- Using hard-to-navigate tools during the interview
- Not spending enough time on pain points (the most important section)
- Coming up with only 1-2 solutions instead of 3-5

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "If you weren't able to come up with a good answer, even with no time constraint, it's going to drive you even more mad to add in the additional time crunch"
- "The pain point section should almost feel like a rant of some of the problems... you're getting so entrenched into the user shoes that you're complaining as if you were one of the users"
- "Your first 1 to 3 solutions are most likely going to be the most common solutions that 95% of the candidates are going to say. The last couple are going to help you peel away from your competition"
- "Taking one to two minutes to think and structure might sound counterintuitive, but that's going to save you a ton of time when you explain and it's going to be so much more concise"
- "What matters more than just your timing is first your performance on these product sense questions"
