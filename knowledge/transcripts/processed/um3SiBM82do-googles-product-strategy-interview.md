- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um3SiBM82do
- **Channel:** Dianna Yau
- **Duration:** 20:31
- **Question Types:** strategy
- **Frameworks Covered:** mission analysis, product portfolio mapping, goal prioritization, challenge identification, user segmentation for businesses
- **Difficulty Level:** advanced

## Summary
This video tackles one of the toughest PM interview questions: "What should [Company X] build in the next five years?" using Google as the example. The presenter demonstrates how to navigate this highly ambiguous question by first understanding Google's business comprehensively, then narrowing scope by selecting and defending a specific goal (diversify revenue vs. compete vs. grow users vs. innovate), identifying target users (small-medium businesses), mapping their challenges, and proposing ambitious product suites rather than individual features.

## Key Takeaways
1. Break down mission statements into key themes to anchor later product vision
2. The question is too ambiguous - you MUST narrow by choosing a specific goal and defending it with clear criteria
3. Context matters: Google's 2023 layoffs and cost-cutting shift priorities from innovation to revenue diversification
4. Think in terms of challenges (big, lofty) rather than pain points (narrow) to enable product suite vs. feature thinking
5. For "5 years out" questions, propose ambitious, meaty solutions - not small features
6. Don't over-rotate on trendy technologies (ChatGPT, AI) without specific use cases solving real challenges
7. Return on investment thinking: prioritize user segments and challenges by revenue potential vs. effort

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Understanding Google's Business

#### Mission Breakdown (Key Themes)
"Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"
- **Knowledge/Information** - core value proposition
- **Universal Accessibility** - next billion users, emerging markets
- **Usefulness** - products must make a difference in people's lives

#### Product Portfolio Map
- **Software:** YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Google Workspace, Search, Ads
- **Hardware:** Pixel phones, Nest (home devices), Google Home
- **Platform:** Android (acquired platform play)
- **Innovation:** Waymo (self-driving), Verily, Google Glass, Project Loon

#### Business Model
- 80% revenue from ads (YouTube, Search, Network ads)
- 20% from licensing (Google Workspace for enterprises), hardware
- Risk: Ad revenue dependent on privacy regulations

### Goal Selection & Prioritization Framework

#### Four Potential Goals for Google
1. **Diversify revenue** beyond 80% ads dependency
2. **Fight off competition** (ChatGPT/OpenAI, TikTok)
3. **Drive user growth** (next billion users, emerging markets)
4. **Continue innovating** (Google X projects, moonshots)

#### Prioritization Criteria
- Highest urgency in current climate
- Highest impact on long-term revenue growth

#### 2023 Context Analysis
- Tech constriction, Google layoffs (tens of thousands)
- Next billion users organization eliminated
- Cost-cutting focus, need for obvious ROI
- Deprioritized: Innovation for innovation's sake (#4), new user acquisition (#3)
- Final choice: **Diversify revenue** (#1) over fight competition (#2)
- Rationale: Competition hasn't threatened survivorship (Facebook coexisted despite Google+ failure)

### User Segmentation (Business Focus)

#### Four User Types Google Could Target
1. **Enterprises** - Large organizations (small % of businesses, large % of GDP/revenue)
2. **Small-Medium Businesses (SMBs)** - 90% of business count [PRIORITIZED]
3. **Solo Entrepreneurs** - Creators, YouTubers starting solo
4. **Everyday Consumers** - Google Nest, Google Home buyers

#### Prioritization Criteria
- Potential revenue growth
- Effort to acquire/serve (ROI)

#### Analysis
- Consumers: Deprioritized (recession, high inflation, reduced digital spending)
- Enterprises: High revenue but costly acquisition, long sales cycles, high quality expectations
- Solo Entrepreneurs vs. SMBs: SMBs have higher revenue ceiling per customer
- **Winner: Small-Medium Businesses**

### SMB Challenges Map

#### Operations Challenges
1. **Hiring** - Finding, training, retaining employees [PRIORITIZED]
2. Digitizing business - Adopting technology
3. Tracking business performance - Customer counts, sales data
4. Financial management - Cash flow, capital in/out

#### Growth Challenges
1. Capital access - Loans, funding to grow
2. Marketing & customer acquisition - Who to target, how to market
3. **Sales growth** - Getting existing customers to buy more [PRIORITIZED]
4. Competition - Competing with larger companies (Walmart effect)

#### Prioritization Logic
- Deprioritized: Digitization, tracking, financial management (not critical if business doing well)
- Hiring: Critical foundation, consistent frustration
- Marketing/acquisition: Already solved well by Google Ads
- **Focused on: Hiring + Sales Growth**

## Sample Questions Covered
- "What should Google build in the next five years?"
- Variations: "What should [Company X] build over the next 3-5 years?"
- Implicit: What goal should guide the strategy? Who should we build for? What challenges exist?

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Not narrowing the ambiguous question by selecting and defending a specific goal
- Thinking in terms of features rather than product suites for "5 year" questions
- Over-rotating on trends (ChatGPT, AI) without specific use cases
- Not using company mission to anchor product vision
- Ignoring current business context (layoffs, market conditions) when prioritizing goals
- Talking about small pain points instead of big challenges
- Not considering ROI when selecting user segments or challenges to address

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "This question is really ambiguous - you can go in so many directions that it's almost overwhelming. You MUST narrow it down by asking 'for what purpose?'"
- "Break out the mission because you're going to use this to develop solutions and a vision for your product"
- "For what purpose in the next 5 years? Diversify revenue? Fight competition? Drive user growth? Innovate?"
- "Today's climate in tech is a bit weird - Google had to nix their next billion users organization and really cut down on costs"
- "Competition does not necessarily mean a significant threat to Google survivorship - they coexisted with Facebook despite Google+ failing"
- "Think about challenges that are big and lofty versus small pain points - that's why I call this section challenges, not pain points"
- "Don't over-rotate on trends like ChatGPT - give specific use cases solving user challenges"
- "Vision: Make it easier to start and scale businesses"

## Solutions Proposed for Google

### Vision Statement
"Make it easier to start and scale businesses"

### Solution 1: Robotics for Hiring Alternative
- Challenge the assumption that businesses need to hire
- Build robots/automation to assist with tasks
- Examples:
  - Self-checkout (Uniqlo NY - no scanning, just detection)
  - Restaurant cooking robots (algorithmic recipe execution)
  - Clothing shop folding, grocery shelf stocking
- Controversial: Reduces hiring needs

### Solution 2: Generative AI for Task Assistance
- Use GenAI to let non-experts accomplish expert tasks
- Example: Marketing copy writing
  - GenAI provides expert copy
  - General employee executes (posting, formatting, placement)
- Reduces need for specialized hires
- Example in practice: Non-technical person using ChatGPT to generate code

### Solution 3: Business Messaging for Sales Growth
- Leverage Google Maps business directory
- Create communication channel between businesses and customers
- Build long-term relationships beyond generic emails
- Customer feedback loop informs what products to build
- Drives sales growth through loyalty and relationship

### Common Thread
All solutions address hiring or sales growth challenges for SMBs while leveraging Google's strengths (maps data, AI capabilities, scale)
