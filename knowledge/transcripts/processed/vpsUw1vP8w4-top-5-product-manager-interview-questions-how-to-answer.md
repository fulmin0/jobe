## Summary
This video provides a comprehensive overview of the five most commonly asked product manager interview questions across top tech companies. For each question type, the presenter shares a structured framework, example questions, common mistakes to avoid, and what interviewers are actually testing. The video serves as a foundational guide for PM interview preparation, with links to detailed example answers for each question type.

## Key Takeaways
1. Have structured frameworks ready for each of the five core PM question types rather than winging answers
2. Interviewers test strategic thinking (big picture, goals, trade-offs) and product design (user empathy, UX, delight) across questions
3. Avoid memorizing checklists - think thoughtfully through frameworks that force critical thinking
4. For favorite product questions: pick products you've actively told friends about, showing genuine passion
5. Always lead with criteria when prioritizing rather than jumping to solutions
6. Product design questions care about process over creative ideas - demonstrate logical, structured, user-empathetic thinking
7. Show specificity in metrics discussions rather than generic DAU/MAU - explain WHY a metric matters for the specific product

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated

### Question 1: Favorite Product (6-step framework)
1. Identify a software, hardware, or physical product
2. State the main goal of the product
3. Identify the users (usually multi-sided ecosystem)
4. Explain how the product helps users accomplish the goal
5. Identify pain points
6. Propose solutions to solve pain points

### Question 2: Product Improvement
- Use the same framework as favorite product
- Be prepared to discuss unfamiliar products by asking clarifying questions
- Study top 10-20 most downloaded apps beforehand

### Question 3: Product Design (4-step framework)
1. Why build for this problem? (validate the opportunity)
2. Who are the users in this space?
3. What pain points exist for target segments?
4. What solutions address prioritized pain points?

### Question 4: Success Metrics (5-step framework)
1. Understand the product (what it does, users, goals)
2. Qualitatively identify what to measure
3. Translate into quantitative metrics
4. Identify 2-3 North Star metrics
5. Define counter metrics and downstream metrics

### Question 5: Debugging/Root Cause Analysis (6-step framework)
1. Ask clarifying questions (timespan, geography, scope)
2. Understand the product
3. Map the user flow
4. Generate hypotheses for the drop
5. Explain validation/invalidation approach
6. Propose solutions for top hypotheses

## Sample Questions Covered
- "What is your favorite product and how would you improve it?"
- "How would you improve Google Maps / Spotify?"
- "What product would you build in the travel space / to help people find roommates?"
- "What metrics would you set for Uber Eats / Airbnb?"
- "We're seeing the number of Uber riders go down - what's going on and how would you fix it?"

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- **Favorite Product:** Ranting about features without structure; not explaining strategic viewpoint
- **Product Improvement:** Listing features you wish existed rather than thinking about target users and their generalizable pain points
- **Product Design:** Starting with solutions and working backwards; prioritizing creative ideas over demonstrating user empathy and problem identification
- **Success Metrics:** Listing generic metrics (DAU, MAU, time spent) without explaining why they matter for the specific product; showing memorization of frameworks (AARRR pirates) rather than thoughtful analysis
- **Debugging:** Going through a memorized checklist rather than thinking through the problem systematically with the framework

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "They're not asking you to rant about your favorite product - they're asking for a structured and strategic viewpoint"
- "Pick a product you've actively told friends about - that means you loved it enough"
- "It's never about the idea, rather the process you walk through to show you can think logically and structurally with user empathy"
- "Make it specific to the product you're talking about, not just throwing out generic metrics that show memorization versus thinking"
- "This isn't high school - you're not going to impress them by memorizing things"
- On testing: "Two things - strategic thinking (big picture, goals, trade-offs) and product design (user empathy, delightful UX with minimum friction)"
- "The toughest question is probably product design" - requires the most open-ended thinking and creativity
