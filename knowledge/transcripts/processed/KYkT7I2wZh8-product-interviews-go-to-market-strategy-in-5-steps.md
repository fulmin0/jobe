- **Frameworks Covered:** 5-Step Go-to-Market Framework, Marketing Strategy Framework
- **Difficulty Level:** intermediate

## Summary
This video provides a comprehensive framework for answering "How would you launch this product?" or go-to-market strategy questions, common in both PM and PMM interviews. Dianna breaks down the approach into five key components: success metrics, target users (who), messaging and positioning (what), channels (where), and timing (when). The framework emphasizes personalization at scale, starting with end goals and working backwards, and thinking creatively about channel selection beyond default options like Facebook and Google ads.

## Key Takeaways
1. Start with end goal metrics (purchases, active users) then work backwards to define conversion levers
2. Define target users with physical, observable attributes rather than motivations for easier targeting
3. Craft brand positioning around specific adjectives you want to be known for (ease of use, budget-friendly, innovation)
4. Channel selection should be based on where users physically are, where they get content, and who influences them
5. Timing matters: consider seasonality, time of day, and life occasions when people are most receptive
6. Balance personalization (which drives engagement) with scale (which drives reach)
7. Prioritize channels based on acquisition cost and conversion volume tradeoffs

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### 5-Step Go-to-Market Framework
1. **Success Metrics:** Define end goal, work backwards through conversion funnel
2. **Who (Target Users):** Segment with observable attributes, prioritize by TAM/frequency/spend
3. **What (Messaging):** Brand positioning, adjectives, tone of copy aligned to user values
4. **Where (Channels):** Physical locations, content sources, influencers, partnerships
5. **When (Timing):** Seasonality, time of day, life occasions

### Channel Discovery Questions
- Which countries? (TAM and complexity considerations)
- Where are people physically hanging out? (billboards on 101, subway ads)
- Where do they get content? (Instagram, NYT, Snapchat)
- Who influences them? (celebrities, institutions, authorities)

### Positioning Strategy
- Choose 1-2 key adjectives to own (ease of use, budget-friendly, high quality, innovation)
- Prioritize based on: what's most important to target users + what aligns to company mission
- Let this permeate through copy, messaging, and strategy

## Sample Questions Covered
- Insurance product launch (used as example for metrics)
- Travel tour booking company (not explicitly stated but implied in structure)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Starting with generic channels (Facebook ads, Google search) without thinking strategically
- Defaulting to motivation-based segments that are hard to target
- Trying to be known for too many things instead of focusing on 1-2 key differentiators
- Not considering the tradeoff between personalization and scale
- Forgetting to work backwards from the end goal metric
- Not giving enough time for marketing activities to take effect (need quarterly, not monthly targets)

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Start with the end goal in mind... then work backwards from it to define the other metrics or levers that are going to help you achieve that key metric"
- "When we think about marketing, it's really important to figure out a way to make marketing and the communication feel personal"
- "A lot of marketing people default to 'oh let's go execute on Facebook ads and Google search.' But let's say you were Uber trying to recruit drivers - is it often that drivers are on Google search? Not necessarily"
- "You've got to target people with your messaging at the right time... For example, let's say a fire is happening in a building and you suddenly tell people 'get a chance to win a million dollars' - people are so stressed out they're not going to be paying attention"
- "It's important to deliver your message at the right time, at the right place... when people are open to listening to a marketing message"
- "Here's to the crazy ones... the brand is speaking so loudly to those who are innovators" (referencing Apple's 1997 ad)
