## Summary
Take-home assignments are increasingly common (50%+ of product roles), and while companies claim they should take "4 hours," they realistically require much more time to do well. This video provides a comprehensive 8-step framework for tackling these assignments, from understanding goals and analyzing data to prioritizing problems, creating strategy, and producing a polished deliverable. The video includes a concrete example of a travel tour booking company with low conversion and retention rates. Dianna emphasizes that take-homes are efficient for companies because they test multiple skills without requiring interviewer time.

## Key Takeaways
1. Take-home assignments test multiple skills efficiently: communication, product thinking, metric definition, and analysis
2. Always start by understanding the company's business model and how the given goal connects to revenue/growth
3. When analyzing data, ask specific questions AND observe broadly for unexpected insights
4. Prioritize problems based on largest impact on the stated goal - often retention problems trump acquisition
5. Create a 3-pronged strategy rather than a single approach to show breadth of thinking
6. Define success metrics starting with the big picture, then break down to strategy-specific metrics
7. Think about pain points from multiple stakeholder perspectives (supply and demand sides)
8. Present MVP solutions focused on testable hypotheses, not 6-month comprehensive builds

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### 8-Step Take-Home Framework
1. **Understand the Goal:** Company business model + explicit goal + how they connect
2. **Analyze Data:** Raw data (pivot tables, charts), tables/graphs (interpret), user feedback (theme buckets)
3. **Prioritize Problems:** Identify 2-3 key problems, prioritize by impact on goal
4. **Create Strategy:** 3-pronged plan of attack to solve the prioritized problem
5. **Measure Success:** Define metrics (big picture + strategy-specific)
6. **Identify Pain Points:** Break down by user stakeholders (supply/demand sides)
7. **Generate Solutions:** 2-3 solutions per strategy, prioritize by impact vs. effort
8. **Write-Up:** 10-section document/presentation

### 10-Section Write-Up Structure
1. Executive summary (TLDR)
2. Business and goal
3. Data insights (lead with statements, not graphs)
4. Prioritized problems list
5. Strategy/plan of attack
6. Success metrics
7. MVP solutions
8. Prioritized solutions (ROI-based)
9. Mocks/wireframes/user flows (optional)
10. Roadmap with timeline

### Data Analysis Approach
- **Ask specific questions:** e.g., "What's revenue breakdown SMB vs. enterprise?"
- **Observe broadly:** Look for unexpected patterns (e.g., 80/20 rule)
- **Pro tip:** Combine both approaches for comprehensive insights

## Sample Questions Covered
- Travel tour booking company: Low viewing (5%), low booking (3%), low retention (2.5%)
- Goal: Increase revenue
- Prioritized problem: Customer satisfaction/retention (the "leaky bucket")

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Not connecting the explicit goal back to business model/revenue
- Leading with graphs instead of interpreted insights/statements
- Trying to solve acquisition/conversion before fixing retention (leaky bucket problem)
- Proposing holistic solutions that take 6 months to validate instead of MVP tests
- Not considering pain points from multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Forgetting the executive summary at the beginning
- Not thinking about break-even timelines for proposed solutions

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "Companies are signing so many take home assignments because it's an efficient way for them to test candidates... no time of an interviewer"
- "If after people book and they're not satisfied, they're not going to come back. And when they don't come back, they also do not recommend a friend, so organic growth is also going to come to a halt... you're going to have a leaky bucket"
- "A strategy is basically a plan of attack"
- "Do not, do not, I emphasize, lead with graphs. Do not just throw a graph in there, leaving the audience to interpret the graph"
- "Think of solutions that you would want to test - MVP as minimal viable product - not holistic solutions that will take six months to build"
- "Acquiring a customer in the first place is pretty costly. So it's in your benefit to retain these customers and keep them in the ecosystem"
