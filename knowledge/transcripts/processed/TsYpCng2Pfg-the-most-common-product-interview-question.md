- **Question Types:** product-sense, behavioral
- **Frameworks Covered:** 4-Part Favorite Product Framework
- **Difficulty Level:** beginner

## Summary
"What is your favorite product and why, and how would you improve it?" is the most common product interview question. Dianna uses "Too Good To Go" (a food surplus app) as her example to demonstrate the framework. The video breaks down the answer into four parts: motivation (problems solved), users and value, why it's a favorite (strategic thinking + product sense), and improvements (pain points + solutions). This question assesses both strategic thinking (business model, engagement tactics) and product sense (good design driving business goals).

## Key Takeaways
1. Choose a product you genuinely use and love - authenticity shows through
2. Explain the problem space first to educate your interviewer (especially for lesser-known products)
3. Demonstrate strategic thinking by discussing business model, supply/demand dynamics, and sustainability
4. Show product sense by identifying specific design choices that drive business goals
5. When proposing improvements, connect pain points directly to key business metrics
6. Prioritize improvements based on impact on core metrics, not just interesting ideas
7. Consider both early user experience (ambiguity/trust) and ongoing user challenges (convenience)

## Frameworks & Techniques Demonstrated
### 4-Part Favorite Product Framework
1. **Motivation:** What problem is this product solving? Why does it matter?
2. **Users & Value:** Who uses it? What value do they get? How does the company benefit?
3. **Why It's My Favorite:**
   - Strategic thinking: business model, supply/demand, engagement/retention tactics
   - Product sense: design choices that drive business goals
4. **How to Improve:** Pain points + solutions, prioritized by business impact

### Strategic Thinking Elements
- **Sustainable business model:** Both sides incentivized without cannibalization
- **Supply/demand balance:** Plethora of restaurants, trial mechanism for businesses
- **Smart design:** Odd hours protect full-price revenue, affordable creates frequency
- **Mission-driven retention:** CO2E saved + money saved metrics drive loyalty

### Product Sense Elements
- **Discovery:** Visual map, filters, ratings (not reviews = simplification)
- **Personalization vs. information:** Right balance to avoid analysis paralysis
- **Emotional design:** Confirmation page makes users feel good about their choice
- **Profile metrics:** CO2E saved, money saved - gamification for social good

## Sample Questions Covered
- "What is your favorite product and why?" - Too Good To Go (full walkthrough)

## Common Mistakes Highlighted
- Choosing a product you don't actually use regularly (lack of authenticity)
- Not explaining the problem space, especially for lesser-known products
- Focusing only on user value without discussing business benefit
- Being too generic in "why it's favorite" - need specific strategic insights
- Proposing solutions that don't connect to key business metrics
- Not prioritizing improvements - listing everything without focus
- Missing the balance between early user concerns (trust) and ongoing concerns (convenience)

## Notable Quotes / Tips
- "How often can you say that about a product? [that it makes you feel good] Most products you use you'll feel like 'oh I'm spending way too much time' or 'I'm spending way too much money'"
- "In the US alone, 30 to 40% of our food is wasted. That is astonishing" (USDA stat)
- "They are basically selling these food at odd hours that might not be the most convenient for customers... that's how they protect businesses from cannibalizing what customers would have paid for dinner"
- "Interviewers are trying to assess two things: strategic thinking and product sense"
- "Not knowing what I'm getting might be an initial pain point if I'm an early customer, but if I had more and more experiences and developed trust for the platform, it shouldn't really impact the number of orders"
- "By helping people get the food in easier ways, Too Good To Go can increase their orders tremendously"
