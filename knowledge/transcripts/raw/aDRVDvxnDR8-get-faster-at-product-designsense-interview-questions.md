[00:00] Managing to answer product sense questions in 45 minutes is one of the key struggles of these product interviews.
[00:07] In this video, I'm going to help set expectations of how long each section of the product sense interview should take
[00:17] so that you get to a complete answer by the end of the interview.
[00:21] Hey guys, I'm Dana and I'm a senior product manager at a large tech company based in Silicon Valley, California.
[00:31] And I bring you the best tips to get into product management and teach you how to succeed once you made it.
[00:37] Before you start optimizing for time, you want to make sure that you can perform well and come up with a solid answer with no time limit.
[00:46] If you weren't able to come up with a good answer, even with no time constraint, it's going to drive you even more mad to add in the additional time crunch and make your performance even worse.
[00:57] So focus on getting to good answers without time constraint, without someone scrutinizing you on the other side, and then start to optimize on video coming faster.
[01:08] We're going to cover four things in this video. First, we're going to break down the product sense question into its section and I'm going to give you how much time should be allocated to each section.
[01:18] Secondly, we're going to talk about areas where you can save time.
[01:23] Thirdly, we're going to talk about areas where you shouldn't be saving time that you should definitely not skip because it's an important part of how you're going to be evaluated.
[01:32] And fourth, we're going to give you some more tips to be even faster in the interview. The interview is usually 45 minutes long.
[01:40] If you take out five minutes for the intro and the interviewer showing up late, that gives you 40 minutes.
[01:46] And if you take out five minutes for the outro that ends up being 35 minutes.
[01:51] If you take out another five minutes for follow-up questions that the interviewer might have throughout the interview or at the end of the interview,
[01:58] that really gives you 30 minutes of you talking to answer this question.
[02:04] So that is your goal when you answer product sense question that you can get it done in 30 minutes.
[02:10] So the product sense question is made up of four sections. The first one starts with why should we build this?
[02:16] The second is user segments. The third is pain points for these target segments. And the last one is solutions.
[02:23] But before you jump into why, you have an intro section where you might clarify some questions.
[02:31] So the start of section should be no more than three minutes. And this encompasses of clarifying questions,
[02:37] which might take two minutes and sharing your structure, which should take no more than around 30 seconds.
[02:43] The structure should be short, concise to the point so that you're ready to dive in.
[02:48] Here, where can you save time? You can save time by avoiding generic questions that are not going to influence your answer.
[02:55] So for example, asking, oh, is this on mobile or desktop? Are there time constraints?
[03:00] Like, these are usual questions that are not going to make your answer better.
[03:04] Here, you can also make some assumptions that you state explicitly.
[03:08] So for example, if you ask, build a product for the grocery store experience, you might make the assumption,
[03:14] I'm going to focus on building this for the US. Is that okay? If you're interviewing for a product manager role in the US,
[03:21] that's a safe assumption to make. What you don't want to skip on and don't want to save time on,
[03:26] is aligning with the interviewer about the space that you guys are going to be talking about.
[03:32] So for example, if the prompt is about travel, you want to align with the interviewer, well, travel is really wide.
[03:38] So for example, if you're talking about getting to the destination travel, organizing the travel,
[03:43] or the actual experience when you're at the place, or capturing the travel, like which part of travel.
[03:49] The second section is the why should we build this?
[03:56] And this should take about five minutes. And a different section under it is first talking about the landscape,
[04:02] such as trends and opportunities, which should take about two minutes.
[04:07] And then you want to talk about alignment to the company's mission, or goals that it sets out for.
[04:13] And this should take no more than one minute. Here, you can save time by not trying to be overly exhaustive in each of the subsections.
[04:20] So for example, if you're going to be talking about strengths, you don't need to list five to six strengths.
[04:25] Two and three should do. What you really don't want to skip here is mentioning its alignment to the company's mission and goals.
[04:34] And here, don't do a generic slash shallow job of alignment. For example, if you're given the question, what product would you build to improve the grocery store experience?
[04:46] And this is say for Facebook, you don't want to say this is helping grocery shoppers and the grocery store owners connect.
[04:53] And that's how it fulfills a mission. That's a shallow way to talk about how aligned with the mission.
[04:59] By the way, has this video been helpful so far? If so, take a second to like the video to support the channel and share this with a friend who might also be preparing for product interviews.
[05:11] The third section of the product sense interview is user segments and user segments should take no more than five minutes.
[05:19] So the first three minutes, you want to come up with the multiple sides of the ecosystem. And then you want to come up with sub segments for one of the sides that you prioritize.
[05:30] So for example, if we talk about the grocery store experience, you'll have one side, which is the grocery store itself, and then the grocery shoppers.
[05:38] And then you want into the sub segmentation of say the grocery shoppers, which sub segments there might be.
[05:44] So the next two minutes, you want to spend prioritizing which of the segments that you want to build for here.
[05:51] You can save some time by not sub segmenting both other sides of the ecosystem.
[05:57] So in our example, you wouldn't want to sub segment both the grocery shoppers and the grocery store, the type of grocery stores.
[06:04] Because that's just going to take way too much time. Priorties one first and then sub segment.
[06:10] Because if you sub segment for both and then you prioritize, you're going to waste a lot of time sub segmenting for the side that you won't end up using anyways.
[06:18] Another place you can save time is not try to be a hundred percent exhaustive in thinking about user segments.
[06:26] Too much talking too much talking too much talking too much talking too much talking too much talking.
[06:30] For example, not coming up with sub segments that make up one or five percent of the population.
[06:36] It's very okay to just think about 80 percent of that segment you're talking about.
[06:41] That's good enough to show to the interview you can break out segments.
[06:45] Another place that you can save time is that when you prioritize, you don't have to spend a lot of time sharing out loud.
[06:55] Why you didn't choose the other segments.
[06:58] Do that part silently so that if the interviewer asks you why you didn't choose the other segments, you have an answer.
[07:06] But when you share your prioritization, lead with what criteria you're optimizing for, what you end up choosing and why, what you end up choosing optimize for that criteria.
[07:17] That can save you a whole lot of time because the prioritization process can get very messy complex, especially if you have a ton of options.
[07:25] However, what you don't want to skip on is doing the actual prioritizing using a objective criteria.
[07:34] So what I mentioned lastly isn't that you don't want to do it.
[07:37] You still want to fairly evaluate all the other options against your criteria.
[07:42] So that you don't want to skip on.
[07:45] The fourth section is one of the most important parts of the question, which is pain points.
[07:51] And this should roughly take about 10 minutes.
[07:54] And here, the interviewer is trying to assess that you have user empathy and are able to come up with some of the things that people struggle with in this space.
[08:03] So under pain points, you start off with a user journey, which should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes.
[08:09] And this is basically mapping out what is the existing users process to accomplish something.
[08:14] Then you want to go into the pain points within the different phases of the user journey.
[08:20] And that should take no more than 5 minutes.
[08:22] I've got so many problems.
[08:24] And once you have a couple of options, you want to start prioritizing, which should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes.
[08:30] So where can you save time?
[08:31] You can save time by coming up with anywhere from 4 to 6 pain points versus going for like 100.
[08:38] There probably is over 100 pain points in particular spaces.
[08:42] But for the sake of this question, where you only have, remember, 30 minutes, you want to come up with 4 to 6 that are the biggest that make up maybe 80% of the challenges.
[08:52] Another place to save time? Similar to the last user segmentation part.
[08:56] You don't have to go through the rationale of every option that you didn't choose.
[09:01] Especially in the pain points section, you want to be careful of this because there tends to be a lot of options when there are pain points.
[09:08] So if you're coming up with 4 to 6, you're going to spend a heck of a long time rationalizing why you didn't choose the other 5.
[09:15] So instead of using that time to talk about why you didn't prioritize the other pain points, use that time to talk about how you prioritize one of the pain points and why that pain point maximizes your criteria that you optimize for.
[09:30] Here, you don't want to skip the process of going through into the pain points and seeing how it evaluates against your criteria.
[09:39] But you want to do this silently on paper, evaluating from 1 to 5 what your pain point might score on on, say, level of pain.
[09:47] Now what you don't want to skip on? Avoid being shallow about your pain points.
[09:53] So here, you want to spend a wealth of time explaining the pain points and showing that deep user empathy.
[10:00] So some joke, the pain point section should almost feel like a rant of some of the problems.
[10:05] So you're getting so entrenched into the user shoes that you're complaining as if you were one of the users.
[10:11] By the way, I'm curious which of the sections in the product sense interview is taking you the longest time in answering.
[10:18] Comment below and let us know.
[10:24] And the last section solutions should take roughly 7 minutes.
[10:29] The first 5 minutes will encompass you coming up with the solutions and verbally sharing your solutions.
[10:35] And here, I recommend sharing the solutions in a way where it's not just a description of the solution,
[10:41] but rather from a user point of view how they might use the solution.
[10:45] Then you want to spend about 2 minutes prioritizing your solution.
[10:49] And you can do this in 2 minutes by just limiting the criteria that you use to impact and effort for choosing solutions.
[10:56] Here, where can you save time? You don't need to overexplain your solution.
[11:00] I'm a rambling. I think I'm rambling.
[11:03] But rather talk through how the user uses your solution. What don't you want to skip on?
[11:10] Instead of coming up with one or two solutions, which I see most candidates doing,
[11:15] because by the time at the end of the interview, they run out of fuel.
[11:19] Try to come up with 3 to 5 solutions.
[11:23] Why? Because your first 1 to 3 solutions are most likely going to be the most common solutions that 95% of the candidates are going to say.
[11:33] And then the last couple are going to help you peel away from your competition.
[11:38] So forcing yourself to think of more than 3 solutions are going to help you stand out more.
[11:43] If there's extra time at the end, the interviewer might ask you to wireframe a solution.
[11:48] They might ask you about risks. Or they may ask you to summarize. Or ask you some general follow-up questions.
[11:54] So let's share some more tips on how you can perform faster during the product sense question.
[12:02] But before we do, take a second to like the video. If this video was helpful, make sure to subscribe to the channel for more content like this.
[12:10] And pay it forward and share this with a friend that might be interviewing as well.
[12:14] So what are a couple other tips to help you in this interview?
[12:17] So number 1, if you're notetaking, take notes in the form of bullet points or sound bites, not full sentences.
[12:24] I tend to see a lot of candidates end up writing out the entire answer, which takes a whole heck a lot of time.
[12:31] But the point of note taking during the interview is to serve as triggers to remind you of when you speak.
[12:38] Not necessarily whole sentences that we as the interviewer can read to understand your answer.
[12:44] So be very careful here. The second, when you're interviewing, make sure you're using easy to navigate tools.
[12:52] Isocandidates who end up using new tools that they struggle with during the interview that actually makes them perform slower.
[12:59] So for example, some companies give you digital whiteboard tools that you can use in the interview.
[13:04] But sometimes they're so hard to use that it slows you down.
[13:08] So go for easy tools like Google Docs, which is going to be easier than using Google's drawing tool.
[13:14] 3. Save time by avoid rambling.
[13:18] A lot of times the candidates that I interview, they waste a ton of time going in circles on what they're talking about or while they're talking, figuring out what they actually want to say.
[13:29] So avoid that by taking out about a minute or two minutes max to think through and structure what you want to say.
[13:38] jot down bullet points and then share.
[13:42] So for some, that might sound counterintuitive.
[13:44] But I'm taking one to two minutes to think.
[13:46] But that's going to save you a ton of time when you explain and it's going to be so much more concise.
[13:52] The next thing is communicate efficiently.
[13:55] A lot of interviews tend to get nervous during the interview or just have speaking patterns where they're using filler words or talking in circles or repeating the same thing over and over again.
[14:07] So as you prepare, you're going to be able to go faster if you speak concisely and simply.
[14:13] And the last tip on how you can become faster is avoid trying to be overly exhaustive and thinking of the 100% and doing something at perfection.
[14:23] Here, because of the shortage of time, you just want to display that you can do the skills that they want to see instead of trying to be 100% perfect in thinking of all the user segment or thinking of all the pain points.
[14:37] Because here is where a lot of people end up spending time using the extra two to three minutes thinking of the 10% of the population or user segment that they missed when that three minutes could have been better served to come up with more creative solutions at the end.
[14:53] I mentioned in the beginning, what matters more than just your timing in answering product sense questions is first your performance on these product sense questions.
[15:03] So take a look at this video series helping you with best practices on answering the product sense question.
[15:11] I go really deep and break out each of the sections on how you should tackle each question to make the answers a whole really solid.
[15:21] See you guys later.
