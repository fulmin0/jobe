[00:00] Are you interviewing for a product manager role soon?
[00:02] If so, one of the most commonly asked questions is
[00:06] what is your favorite product and why and tell me how you would improve it?
[00:10] Easy, right?
[00:10] What I see candidates fail in this question all the time because they don't come prepared.
[00:15] They think to themselves, this question is way too easy.
[00:18] The interviewer just isn't going to ask me this question.
[00:20] Well, you thought wrong because most interviewers don't necessarily come very prepared.
[00:25] So they go to the first question that they can think of.
[00:27] So please don't fail the easy question.
[00:31] And today I'm going to walk you through how I would answer this question
[00:35] and then show you what my favorite product is and why.
[00:38] Hey everyone, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a big tech company in Silicon Valley, California.
[00:44] And I bring you the best tips to help you get into product management
[00:48] and teach you how to succeed once you've made it.
[00:51] So today we're going to ask one of the most commonly asked questions.
[00:55] What is your favorite product?
[00:57] Why and how would you improve it?
[00:59] So let's go through a simple three part structure.
[01:01] The first part, pick the product.
[01:03] Pick a product that you would rave about to your friends and that you personally love.
[01:07] Second, identify needs and pain points that product is solving for you and people like you.
[01:13] Third, and lastly, what key pain points are not being solved today that could be strategic
[01:18] opportunities for the company.
[01:20] So let's show you how I use this in a specific example.
[01:23] So the first step, picking a product that you actually love.
[01:26] I love using Yelp.
[01:27] Before the pandemic, I joke that Yelp was like my bible because I was using it all the time
[01:32] because every time I went out to pick a restaurant, I would be using Yelp.
[01:36] So still people ask me what product do I choose?
[01:39] And like I said, pick a product that you personally love.
[01:42] But one that isn't too complex that would require a lengthy time to explain it to the interviewer.
[01:47] But also not a product that's so commonly used that the interviewer might have heard
[01:52] the same answer five times before you came in.
[01:55] And if the product is not very familiar to the interviewer, feel free to take your phone
[02:00] and show it to the interviewer and introduce the product to them.
[02:03] Okay, so now let's go to the second step.
[02:05] And this is your opportunity to show strategic thinking.
[02:09] So identify the key needs and pain points here that this product, in my case, Yelp is solving
[02:14] for me and people like me.
[02:16] The first problem that Yelp was solving for me before it existed was helping me discover
[02:22] new businesses.
[02:23] Before Yelp, I would be googling and landing on people's blogs to find out about restaurants.
[02:29] I would get personal recommendations from friends.
[02:31] I would look at what's listed on the Michelin Star list.
[02:34] And all of these ones were not efficient because it took a lot of time.
[02:38] And two were pretty biased.
[02:39] So Yelp really helped me discover businesses that were viewed by everyday people like myself
[02:45] and by the masses.
[02:47] The second pain point Yelp helped me solve was giving me information about the business
[02:52] that helped me make a decision whether I wanted to visit the business or not.
[02:56] Before Yelp, I would have to go to that specific restaurant or businesses website
[03:01] if they had one and go on multiple websites to find information and to be able to compare.
[03:06] And if they didn't have a website, where would I go find photos of the food,
[03:10] of how big the place is and of the atmosphere.
[03:13] So Yelp brought all of that information together which empowered me to be able to decide
[03:18] which local business to visit.
[03:19] The third problem that helped me solve was giving me an easy way to actually connect directly
[03:25] with the business.
[03:26] So before Yelp, I would have been calling the business or googling, looking for the website
[03:32] to find a phone number.
[03:34] And it was again an inefficient process.
[03:37] And now I know exactly where on the Yelp screen to find the businesses contact information.
[03:43] So those are some of the needs that became fulfilled when Yelp came onto the stage.
[03:47] Now, still part of the second step, you want to talk about how Yelp solves these needs.
[03:54] I know I already started talking a little bit about it because again, I love the product.
[03:58] But let me give you a more strategic way to talk about how Yelp solves those needs.
[04:04] Let's go back to the needs and key pain points that I talked about above and see how Yelp
[04:09] actually addresses them.
[04:10] So the first one was Yelp helps me discover new business.
[04:13] And specifically, Yelp is one of the largest directories of businesses in the US.
[04:18] It creates very easy and efficient ways to search for places, but it also has a home screen that
[04:24] helps me discover places.
[04:25] So in the search functionality, the one I use the most is searching by neighborhood.
[04:30] So oftentimes, I'll be exploring a new neighborhood.
[04:32] And I just type in restaurants at the top.
[04:35] I'll show you here.
[04:36] And it gives me a listing of places that are nearby, which makes it super convenient.
[04:40] Sometimes when I know I'm going to a neighborhood, I won't use a nearby function,
[04:44] but I'll put in the neighborhood or the address of the place I'm going to.
[04:48] And again, all of these are efficient ways to help me find a place that's convenient,
[04:53] but also great and well known in that neighborhood.
[04:56] And a couple of other criteria is to help you narrow down and make an efficient decision without
[05:01] having to go through 10 different websites.
[05:03] The second problem that Yelp helped me solve is getting the necessary business information
[05:07] to help me decide whether I was going to visit the business or not.
[05:11] It stands out by having a next level of detail that wouldn't even exist on the business's website.
[05:17] So for example, Yelp tells you whether the place is good for groups, whether they accept credit cards,
[05:23] whether it's pet friendly.
[05:25] These aren't usually things listed on a business's website, even if they had one,
[05:29] but it is a key component in your decision.
[05:32] For example, how many times have they gone into a restaurant and only realized once we arrived
[05:37] that they didn't accept credit card and had to walk five to 10 blocks annoyingly to find a near ATM?
[05:43] Or how many times have you walked into a restaurant and came with a group of 10 people
[05:47] and realized it was a hole in the wall with four seats.
[05:50] So by Yelp providing you that next level of information,
[05:54] you can make smart decisions about the businesses that you visit or prepare ahead of time.
[05:58] And most importantly, the type of business information it provides are things like photos
[06:04] of the restaurant from everyday people, which again helps me see for myself
[06:09] is the business big enough to fit a group of 10?
[06:12] What is the atmosphere of the business?
[06:14] And these are photos and because these photos are uploaded by everyday people,
[06:19] I feel a sense of security that this isn't just the business showing me the best of the business.
[06:24] And of course, the rating then reviews is a key component.
[06:28] My friends always make fun of me that I'm such a snob and I only chew the four-star restaurants.
[06:34] And the third key pain point it's helping me solve is connecting me directly to the business.
[06:39] Again, a lot of small businesses don't necessarily have website or have a direct way to contact them
[06:45] except through the phone, but also how would you find their phone number if they're not a digital first
[06:50] business where they would know to put their phone number on a website?
[06:53] So on Yelp, they give businesses away one to add their phone number or to allow other people
[06:59] who have frequented the business to add their phone number.
[07:02] But two, they give small businesses a messaging platform.
[07:05] So I remember a couple of years ago, I visited a salon and it allowed me to message the business
[07:10] to book an appointment. It gave us a convenient way to easily become a patron of the business.

[07:24] The third part is where interviewers are testing your creativity and how you think as a product leader.
[07:30] Most people will use this part to just rattle off cool features that they thought of,
[07:35] that they would personally like, that is not what you want to do.
[07:39] Even if you come up with great ideas, how you'll really stand out if you identify the company's
[07:44] key top goals and media opportunities that will help the business grow and prioritize the ones
[07:52] that could have the most impact on the company's growth. Let's walk you through what this looks like.
[07:57] So I'm going to start off with the goal. So the biggest value that Yelp provides for users
[08:01] is driving discovery and helping people visit businesses. Yelp also most likely wants to help
[08:08] businesses directly drive sales from Yelp to the business. And it seems like in the last couple
[08:13] years Yelp is making a more intentional effort towards that. So when we think about Yelp's revenue,
[08:18] at least the ones that I know, two main streams. The first is through sponsored listings. So those
[08:24] are when businesses pay to show up first when you do a search for a restaurant. So it's kind of like
[08:28] Google ads. The second is businesses take a commission for every sale they enable. So whether
[08:34] that's a delivery order or an appointment. So it seems like the top use case people use Yelp for
[08:39] today and where it does the best job is discovery. But what could be some strategic opportunities for
[08:46] Yelp to drive even more discoveries? So I have three opportunities here. The first one is to build
[08:51] a community concept to help everyday people discover businesses from some of the top influencers
[08:58] on Yelp. On reviews, there are people who have the word elite on their tag. And these are people
[09:02] who have reviewed a ton of restaurants. And these are people I wanted to be getting recommendations from.
[09:08] But today I don't believe there's a way to follow them. And I can imagine a world where they create
[09:14] lists. And whenever I go visit a new city, I'm looking for their best list because these are probably
[09:20] foodies and people I aspire to be. A second concept to help drive more discoveries. Yelp could
[09:25] dive deeper in personalization. So today if you look at the home screen, right now they'll give you
[09:30] a recommendations based on what's popular in the city or places based on what you've saved to your
[09:36] list. And instead of providing single dimension recommendations, I think their algorithm could get
[09:42] a bit smarter in predicting what businesses I'd like to visit. For example, people tend to love to
[09:48] visit really popular businesses that are up and coming. Here I can see a placement on the home screen
[09:54] where every week where they recommend businesses that are getting a ton of traffic or PR recently.
[10:00] Which can get me set up for the weekend when I go out with friends and looking for a cool place to
[10:04] visit. On this front, it could also take information from who I follow and who I'm friends with.
[10:09] So if my friends have visited a place, I'm maybe more likely to visit a place because we're
[10:14] either similar or I'll take my friends' recommendations stronger than if I saw an ad or even if I saw it
[10:19] on Yelp. So those are some ways that I think Yelp could provide a bit more personalization
[10:24] to enable more discovery. The last recommendation I'll provide for helping Yelp drive more discoveries
[10:30] is thinking about content creation. Where do you think a lot of people find businesses and discover
[10:36] businesses today? It's on Instagram. People see amazing photos of a pastry or some food at a
[10:43] business and that's how they learn about it. Even though Yelp isn't necessarily a social platform,
[10:49] it can encourage businesses to post more about updates that take gorgeous food porn photos as a way
[10:56] to capture people's attention. Imagine Yelp's home screen a part of it turning into a destination
[11:02] where people are exploring rather than just using the search function, which today is the main
[11:07] use case and how most people find restaurants and Yelp. I see this as a theme of turning Yelp from
[11:12] a search led platform to an exploration discovery platform. And why the latter could be a bit more
[11:20] powerful is because you don't have to wait around for the person to go search. Instead, if you
[11:25] create a behavior where people come to Yelp just to learn about new businesses, just as they would
[11:31] want to get updates from their friends and family when they go on Facebook or Instagram,
[11:35] there's a chance we can turn this product into one where people are spending more time on. So
[11:40] discoverers one piece of it. A sales is another key component that could really help Yelp
[11:46] prove to businesses that Yelp is helping them drive sales. So in the last years I've seen Yelp turn
[11:52] into a top of funnel where they just show the businesses website and address and facilitate people
[11:56] there to going a level deeper and helping customers complete transactions on Yelp itself, which
[12:03] that frictionless experience could increase the number of sales that a business is getting. So for
[12:08] example, restaurants is one of the main types of businesses on Yelp today and they've done a great
[12:14] job partnering with GrubHub to provide deliveries. Also for appointment types of businesses, they allow
[12:20] you to create a point and appointment today for businesses like hiring plumbers or locksmiths,
[12:26] they create a form that you can fill out to request more information from them and a quote. So what
[12:31] else could Yelp do here? Well one, it can further go down the list to see what other businesses are
[12:37] really popular on Yelp that people are searching for and go deeper in the funnel to provide unique
[12:43] experiences that help them drive more sales. This is a very common use case, but if retail clothing
[12:50] shops was something people would popularly search for on Yelp, you might think creating a catalog of
[12:55] products on Yelp where people can browse the actual products. Could help retail stores sell more.
[13:01] Another opportunity with sales is can Yelp help these businesses upsell? So in the delivery space,
[13:08] we talked about today, they help users like you and I order delivery. So is there an opportunity
[13:13] when I'm ordering a burger and fries that they recommend to me? The shape goes well with the fries,
[13:20] so that's helping that burger join. Add incremental marginal revenue that wouldn't have happened
[13:25] if Yelp did recommend it to me. Another upsell opportunity for those hair salons and beauty salons
[13:31] that require an appointment. Once I'm done with my appointment for that day, could they remind me
[13:36] to book my next appointment? So these are a couple ways that I think Yelp could help increase
[13:41] sales on the platform to help businesses feel like Yelp is a great destination for them to grow
[13:47] their business. Those are these categories helping increase discovery and helping businesses
[13:51] increase sales could be tremendous in helping it beat out other competitors like Google Maps,
[13:57] which in the last year have been gaining more momentum in the same space as Yelp. So this is the
[14:02] way I would answer what is your favorite product and why and how would you improve it? To summarize,
[14:07] first, pick a product that you actually personally love. Second, identify key needs that the product
[14:13] is helping you and people like you solve. And third, identify strategic opportunities that's aligned
[14:19] with the businesses goals. So I hope that was helpful. Again, this is not the question you want to
[14:25] fail on because it's one of the easiest questions you'll get in the product manager interview. So
[14:29] take some of these tips we talked about today and construct your own answer and make sure you walk
[14:34] into the interview prepared with your favorite product and why. If you're preparing for interviews,
