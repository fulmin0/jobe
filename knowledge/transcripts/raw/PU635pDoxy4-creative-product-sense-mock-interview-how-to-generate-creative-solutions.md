## Transcript

[00:00] Hi everyone, I'm Diana, former PM at meta and straight and today we have Austin who ace his meta interviews and now is a PM at meta so can you do short intro by yourself.
[00:10] Sure, happy to I'm Austin and currently a new PM and meta working on cameras across all the extra portfolios.
[00:19] I used to work at Apple in the vision product group as well as Niantic, which is a Google spin off for the air glasses and most recently also a startup working on AI and all M aspects as a product manager.
[00:31] Super excited to help and you know Diana here has helped me so much throughout my interview prep process. I watched all her videos multiple times, took lots of notes for each videos and yeah, it really helped me a lot. I have a tip at the end to share, but you know very excited to be here today.
[00:47] Austin was a star a student taking notes religiously and all shares tips at the end using chat GBT to use those notes to teach him even more.
[00:56] Awesome, so today we're going to get into a product design question. Great, let's dive in. So Austin, your APM at Google Maps, where are thinking about building a parking solution, what, might you build and why.
[01:10] Sounds good. And before we get started, I'll ask some clarifying questions, but I'm used to sharing my screen.
[01:16] Is that okay? Yeah, sure. Of course.
[01:19] I take a moment just to type down my approach so we can be a line there and I'm going to ask my clarifying questions. Yes, great.
[01:31] Awesome, so my approach on a high level would just be, you know, making sure that I understand we are on the same page what Google Maps is and also what we mean by parking solution.
[01:40] Then I'd love to just quickly address Google's sort of mode, the strength, if there's any opportunity for them.
[01:47] And then come up with a goal, like, like, what is the benefit of having a parking solution for Google for Google Maps, then we can anchor our sort of following response to that.
[01:58] I'll go through the larger ecosystem supply and demand side talk about the user segments and then go through, you know, prioritize them, go through the user journey identify pain points and making sure that a solution, a journey.
[02:09] So I'll go through the data solution address both the goals and the pain points. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds great. Let's get into it. Awesome.
[02:18] So for clarifying questions, I just want to ask when we think about parking solution, are you thinking about just improving sort of enhancing that Google Maps apps with a parking solution or a parking solution that's really blue sky sort of infrastructure changing for Google.
[02:37] Yeah, no limitations from my side, let your creativity run wild.
[02:43] That's too focused on, yeah, what the pain points might be and go from there.
[02:47] Makes sense.
[02:49] Cool. So let's make sure again, we are on the same page for what Google Maps is today.
[02:54] My understanding of Google map, most people use it. It's the versatile platform that really empowers users to navigate from point A to point B and also discover new places, right?
[03:05] And you're traveling and also engage with local business seamlessly, right? If you people are giving reviews, looking at ratings and seeing whether businesses open or not.
[03:15] There's other really cool features that allow a driver when you're driving to click and I'm looking for a coffee shop or gas station or even I believe perhaps parking spots, but usually they only show certain like parking garage today. Yeah, exactly.
[03:31] So hopefully we're aligned as to what Google Maps is today.
[03:34] Awesome.
[03:36] In terms of, you know, Google's strength and mission and so forth for Google Maps specifically.
[03:44] It has a lot of data and a lot of user base already today, right? It has a larger user base. We have the GPS locations of all these locations.
[03:53] And even business reviews, as I said, now Google has their own most recently focusing on AI and LM and J and AI as well.
[04:02] So all of this will merge together as something that will make Google Maps stand out from competitors and speaking of competitors, we'll of course get the Apple maps.
[04:11] We have ways and so forth as a map competitor in terms of parking solution competitors or people in the ecosystem just after like spot hero or believe paid by phone where people can pay for their spots or look for long term parking solutions.
[04:27] Thank you for sharing that.
[04:29] Cool. So let me spend maybe a moment just to type down the goals of what we're trying to do today.
[04:38] Why is this beneficial for Google why is the parking spot solution something that Google want to look into right because as a product manager, if this doesn't make sense, maybe we don't want to get into the parking space.
[04:50] Right. So give me a moment.
[04:52] Okay.
[04:59] So for the goal, right, ultimately parking solution is one of many benefits of Google Maps, right, increases its value, its utility for users, ultimately what we're trying to do.
[05:13] I believe this right, we can increase the engagement for our users so they can spend more time there, making them want to use Google maps more increase the users that is affection at the same time because they're spending more time on it, right, we're gathering more data to address, you know, our strength.
[05:28] And our mode, our differentiation of having more data to improve our gen AI long term.
[05:36] Another really important point, I believe is, Google's highest revenue is its ads business right now we have more user data to understand where they're parking what sort of their behavior is and perhaps be able to target ask better based on where they're going and what they're doing in that parking aspects.
[05:57] Yeah, and we try to monetization. I think that also has its benefit in making sure people are using the Google pay aspects more and with payment right Google can better monetize from all types of users as well.
[06:11] That's good point.
[06:12] Okay.
[06:13] Awesome.
[06:14] All right, let's go.
[06:15] Next up, I want to talk about the ecosystem before diving into the user segmentation.
[06:21] When I think of ecosystem for most questions, I think about, you know, the supply and demand side as well as sometimes the middle player, which in this case is Google, right, scattered data providing support.
[06:34] But from a supply side, we have the on a high level parking space providers.
[06:39] And on a demand side, sorry, it's wrong.
[06:44] The men's that we have the drivers looking to park.
[06:49] Usually, I would pick one side of the ecosystem and dive deep into the user segmentation, but I think for this sort of new feature is important to consider both.
[06:59] You need a healthy ecosystem for this to work.
[07:03] So let me go into user segmentation.
[07:09] Give me a quick moment to type down so I can verbalize better.
[07:12] Okay.
[07:19] So when I think about user segmentation, I often think about maybe their behavior or motivation and one.
[07:26] One good way to think about it is how frequent is this space being, I guess, either a dress or use that helps me create a mental model, right, like from the least frequent sort of users or user segments to the most frequent user segments.
[07:44] And that helped me brainstorm easily during interviews on the supply side.
[07:49] And the most common ones on the street is like the public street spots. Right. So that's usually owned by governments.
[07:55] And, you know, on the least more or less frequent side, we have the private aspects, right. We have a malls that only exists like maybe it is one or two malls in in a city, depending on city size.
[08:08] So we have that.
[08:09] And also private spots like parking lots that owned by private owners or private businesses.
[08:14] The fourth one, I believe there's a lot of them, but it's a spot owners where I own, for example, a apartment condo and I own a spot in a parking lot, right.
[08:27] That's that's another opportunity for as a parking space providers.
[08:33] And in that space, we can also think about maybe a plaza that has like a restaurant and then the restaurants that extra spot extra spots there, right.
[08:41] That can also be an avenue for the restaurants to provide parking spots for people.
[08:46] Interesting.
[08:47] We call the supply side. So on the demand side, we have drivers looking to park.
[08:52] There's on the higher disease side where people are looking for a spot for a short term. Let's say when they're going on a last minute, dinner date or looking to shop or looking to meet a client immediately.
[09:05] Then we have on the other side, like super long term parking, where I know a head of time that I'm switching to a new job and there's not much parking space. I need a long term parking solution there.
[09:16] And then in the middle, it could be someone like me who's a renter looking for a long term parking spots for one year or two year, because the apartment complex or wherever I'm renting doesn't have doesn't provide a parking spot.
[09:33] I'm thinking a lot of demands.
[09:36] So which would you prioritize?
[09:39] So question.
[09:41] Yes, before prioritizing, I want to write out sort of the criteria that I use to prioritize.
[09:47] I would anchor on reach, you know, sort of that market size frequency of use and underserved population.
[09:57] But in this case, we wouldn't call parking space providers population, maybe just underserved users.
[10:03] And in terms of time, I'm doing an interview, I wouldn't create like a table, it takes a little bit of time. So here, I'll just like quickly type, type the ranking next to them.
[10:13] Okay, sure. Yeah, take a second.
[10:15] Yeah, thank you.
[10:19] Something I just want to quickly elaborate is that we again, we need a healthy ecosystem for this to work because if you have a healthy amount of supply, then the demand side can find your parking spots, right?
[10:33] But if you don't, then we still reach this sort of economical problem of finding a spot and that doesn't serve Google maps at all.
[10:43] Yeah, well, make sure that we address both sides and oftentimes we want to jumpstart sort of that supply side to make sure that people looking for spots can actually find a spot.
[10:53] That's why I might put a little bit more focus on the supply side as well.
[10:56] Alright, that makes sense.
[10:58] Cool. Let me explain a little bit. And in the interest of time, I would just focus on the ones that I rank highly.
[11:05] And then if you have more questions, we can I can help justify the other ones as well.
[11:09] So for the parking space providers, I highlighted spot owners, because you know, compared to public street parking, right?
[11:19] They have fewer reach, but still decent amount that's not addressed today, which is where I rank as extra large, you know, they're under service.
[11:29] I don't believe there's existing solutions for spot owners to rock has or advertise your spots.
[11:35] And the frequency of use what what I mean is that how frequent is the spot available?
[11:41] And for spot owners, maybe like again, like a harming complex on the owner or a business owner.
[11:47] The spots are not always taken. Maybe they go out on a vacation, maybe they go out working or they just extra spots laying there.
[11:54] So I would say like it's not the largest, not as small as as medium.
[11:58] So that's why I'm highlighting this.
[12:01] On the demand side, right? I think the highest most obvious or instructor parking people who are constantly, there's a lot of people so they reach is high for looking for last minute parking solutions.
[12:13] And then frequency views is high to I think even within the night, if you're driving, you could be looking for a parking spot twice if you're going from point A to point B and point B to point C.
[12:26] Lastly, the reason why ranked them as under service user as medium is because today people are still able to find parking spots with, you know, I believe there are existing apps that show like general parking availability.
[12:42] I believe like even on the payments that we have to pay by phone as an app to address that.
[12:48] So that's a medium there.
[12:51] I'm curious between spot owners and government back to the supply.
[12:56] We are seeing large and large for region frequency of use.
[13:03] Yes, so I guess why did we prioritize number four over number one.
[13:07] That's a hard one.
[13:10] Frankly, yes, it has high reach. It has high frequency of use today on a public spot perspective. But I think the thing to highlight is that.
[13:21] Again, it has, it's this base is already sort of over served. That's why it's put as S right.
[13:29] That can easily find a spot out there. And this is on my government is a little bit hard to address that space.
[13:37] And I see. And when you say it's already served.
[13:42] I guess in that case, people are still struggling to find spots. The government ones that are available.
[13:48] Right.
[13:50] So I'm addressing the supply side basically, right. Because they don't have problem opening up the spot. I guess.
[13:58] I see a lot of them out there. I see. Okay, there's already a lot of existing out there.
[14:03] Let's keep going.
[14:06] Right. So after sort of prioritizing these two, as I mentioned, my focus on the supply side a little bit more to sort of jumpstart this ecosystem.
[14:17] So I'm going to focus on the spot owners, but also keep the short term partners in mind.
[14:23] So next up is user journey and pain point.
[14:29] So I'm going to take a moment to think about that, jot that down and demonstrate sort of that user journey and the pain points within that.
[14:39] So again, even for user journey and pain points, I also want to mention it's important to have the criteria is down. So we know what the prioritize from a user perspective.
[14:48] If you think about a spot owners.
[14:52] Well, usually they, if if I'm a private spot owners like someone who owns a apartment complex with a parking spot. Usually I work, maybe close on vacation.
[15:02] And then I noticed that I have a utilized spots.
[15:07] Right, let me type this down. Utilize spots.
[15:11] And I might not be sure whether this is something I can monetize. Right. So there's an awareness to uncertainty part.
[15:19] Next up, I want to be able to share and promote these empty spots and also send up pricing because again, there's a bunch of uncertainty in terms of how this might work.
[15:31] If I were to be in a apartment complex, there's also access issue right people need to enter the parking spot parking lot.
[15:38] I want to make sure that I can monitor the space to make sure that the person parking is, you know, isn't I guess, trashing the spot in the urban city or making sure that they are driving the car away.
[15:53] So when I return from my vacation or my job, I have my spots ready.
[15:59] And then I want to make sure that I can collect payments. Right, to monetize this. That's why I'm to incentivize to do this thing. And then finally, collect reviews and make sure that just recurring partners coming back.
[16:13] So this becomes a long long term avenue of revenue basically.
[16:18] This also applies to spots owners who let's even own a business because at the same time, I want to make sure that these apply as well.
[16:30] Yeah, I guess.
[16:32] It's serious for the first year, they leave from work. I think what do you think would motivate people to be like, aha, I could monetize this extra spot.
[16:41] Trying.
[16:43] I think the motivation may be especially in the urban city area where like housing prices is high, people are paying mortgage is it's cool.
[16:51] It's good to know that they have like another avenue of sort of offsetting their mortgage, for example, from a business perspective.
[17:01] Yeah, I think from a business perspective, they just want to increase revenue, right. So this is another reason why you know, they if they have an utilized spots and they can monetize it, there's motivation there.
[17:12] That's a good point. Yeah, when I was living San Francisco, I did have a garage didn't have a car. So it was just empty there and knowing people are paying $500 per month for the rush space.
[17:22] Yes, absolutely. And even if you have a car, right, it's not always utilized that empty spots if you're driving out during the day.
[17:32] There.
[17:33] Cool.
[17:34] So for the pain point, when people are leaving for work, right, again, they have, as you mentioned just now, they have no idea that they can rent out a spot and get income.
[17:43] So I think it's a high awareness thing for them to understand that there's an avenue for them to utilize the spot and monetize.
[17:51] And then the second thing is that if they are aware already, there's a desire to reach more people to again maximize that income revenue potential.
[18:02] Thirdly, for in terms of pricing, people aren't sure how much to charge right we charge to no one's going to come park.
[18:09] So little you're missing out monetization opportunity.
[18:14] Moving on to access and sort of monitoring. I think there's a lot of trust issues here, right?
[18:18] You're in a apartment garage or you have your own parking spot that you only don't want people again to go trash them or not leave the spot.
[18:28] And you don't want strangers that have strangers who might have my intention to be, you know, doing harm to your property.
[18:37] And you don't want to be a security and sort of access type of pain points there as well.
[18:43] Moving on, right, and without without a payment solution, right, how does one handle payment do you do like a private memory to you exchange cash.
[18:55] So just uncertainty on how to end handle the payment as well.
[18:59] Finally, right, once this is set up, you want to make sure that people come back again and again and, you have to make sure that people love the spot they're providing.
[19:08] Maybe it's a spot that's big enough for the type of cars they have, for example, so building that trust is important.
[19:15] So these are the pain points and I took some time to rank them.
[19:20] And I just want to highlight the few that I believe has sort of the higher highest pain point in terms of security of pain and no existing solutions today.
[19:30] Okay. When you say severity of pain, explain that to me a bit.
[19:35] It's a little bit frankly subjective, right? It's like how painful it is for these parking providers today.
[19:42] I see. Okay. Got it.
[19:45] So in terms of no existing solution, right, if that's the opportunity space where Google can come address, right, if you have no existing solution, that means user satisfaction, user satisfaction isn't being addressed today.
[19:59] Okay. Okay.
[20:01] So yeah, these are the ones I highlighted, maybe justification why I had it at them is again, I guess for awareness.
[20:12] I don't mean I want to earn income, but I would say like it's in the middle. That's why it's a medium, right, because if someone owns the apartment and they have enough money, perhaps they don't care whether they have this small extra stream of income.
[20:25] In terms of existing solution today, I don't think there's any for private spot owners.
[20:31] That's why I rank medium at large.
[20:34] For pay, how to handle payment, I think this payment side is a huge trust issue when we talk about money. So severe to pay and it's really high.
[20:42] And if there's any existing solution, yes, you can have offline, them owing, zelling or cash exchange, but so there's some existing solution, but it's not like they're the best. So I rank a medium, for example.
[20:54] Oh, and I missed this one. So I want to make sure I can get my spots back. If I'm a spot owner, I want to make sure I can come back at my spots ready for the next person or have my own car.
[21:05] Be able to park there when it's available. And this is like one of the highest pain and also there's no existing solution as well.
[21:12] Cool.
[21:14] I guess that one is especially pertinent for the short term parking.
[21:18] Right, right. And that also addressed that sort of demand side as well.
[21:22] So what might we build and go for it in time?
[21:27] On the solution side, let me. So before I brainstorm what I'd like to do normally is to go back to our goals on the top.
[21:34] So making sure.
[21:36] Or dress that goals as well as the pain points we just identified. So let me take a moment. I've got down in a brainstorm.
[21:41] Okay.
[21:42] Right. So in terms of goals, Google wants to build a parking solution for our brand parking spot owners and short term parking seekers to increase Google map utility value and engagement.
[21:55] So here I'm addressing both the user side with part heights as well as the goal we talk about out there.
[22:00] And the pain to address the three pains we were addressing are the ones I highlighted, which is awareness, right.
[22:06] And let me know that there's additional income stream trust making sure that people trust that they can get their back of parking spots back for the next customers or for themselves to use.
[22:16] And then finally to handle payments right to make sure this transaction actually goes to and then there's again trust in that process.
[22:24] Clear.
[22:25] Yeah, the three solutions I came up with. I was just go high level first before diving down.
[22:31] I love is to utilize existing Google map.
[22:35] For the parking spots owners to indicate that there's a parking spot show them the setup flow, right, entering how many spots they have what the address is.
[22:46] Maybe the XYZ dimension of the parking spots.
[22:50] And then on the demand side, right, we can have people switch the view of when they're driving off Google map to look for those plots and look at the pricing and making sure that both sides work.
[23:02] The details here is that how do we address.
[23:06] Whether as user can get their spots back or not. So my suggestion here is to take pictures for drivers and owners to show their spots or show that the cars are has left the space to make sure that we build a trust there.
[23:20] And they can address that payment aspects, right. We enter the credit card information or bank account information and then making sure that transaction happens ahead of time.
[23:31] The next one is heat map. This is just a show.
[23:35] You know what area has a higher supply and demand to help match sort of driver's seeking for parking spots and owners trying to rent out their spots.
[23:45] The idea is also like overtime we can build a rating or trust profile for the spots owners, sort of like those small medium sized business or restaurants that they have like ratings and reviews.
[23:57] And this allows us to better match and also highlight areas where there's like highly trusted parking spots for the drivers.
[24:07] And finally, I think Google has this mode and also owning several hardware in the ecosystem. Just Google net cameras. I think we can utilize the camera to capture empty spots and license plates to again address that trusting.
[24:21] And the Google has its own, you know, R&D department that I can think about some blue sky solution to create IELT gadgets that maybe it's not a camera but can identify whether cars there or not.
[24:34] Even more while like a motorized platform in a garage that has maximized empty space provides entry and payment when a driver is entering and also trust right because you were managing that motorized platform within a parking garage.
[24:50] So the third solution I thought of is, you know, utilizing Google's hardware mode. Google has their nest cameras has their IELT products.
[25:01] And I think, for example, the net cameras can help the spot owners address sort of the trust issue that we identify right we can now whether a parking parker basically are they driving the cars away at the park their cars.
[25:17] What is your license plate to increase that right if they're.
[25:22] Trashing the spot or not leaving the spots we have the license plate we tied the parkers to their payment system now we can make sure that is sort of a type of insurance to making sure that they leave the spot.
[25:35] They don't you would charge them more or provide a you know get a penalty basically to compensate the supply side.
[25:44] And then and then a little bit bigger ideas to just for Google to create a completely new hardware product to help detect the car doesn't have to be like the nest cameras maybe it's overpowered for its use case maybe we just need approximately sensor sensor perhaps like a NFC for people to pay on the spot if that's not tied to the Google pay system.
[26:08] So yeah basically this is a part with play solution.
[26:12] All of these three solutions but the way I would prioritize them is with the criteria of just high level like.
[26:20] Impact and effort but in terms of impact I want to make sure that impact is related to what our goal is which again is increasing utility or even engagement of Google maps app that's how to do them.
[26:33] Okay I can take some time to like sort of write a criteria. Yeah.
[26:38] So based on the criteria of impact and effort and again impact is engagement or value provided in terms of parking solutions.
[26:50] The one I'm prioritizing is the Google map parking indication solution sort of that into.
[26:57] So this is like heat map or a hard way play right for example hard way play probably requires a lot of effort for us to rent a hard way to win or even build new hardware from the growing up.
[27:07] I think it's a small impact and small effort because in terms of effort right we already have a map out there we have the infrastructure for people who reviews and all we need to do is to show how populate how popular it is for someone to indicate that they're renting a car parking spot or how popular it is for someone to be looking for a spot.
[27:30] So the heat map solutions quite simple but I don't think the impact is as high as a sort of brand new solutions as number one.
[27:39] Awesome. So let's be for number one bit more.
[27:43] So I get on the driver side that seems pretty straightforward for the parking owner side.
[27:51] What is the MVP for the user flow you're thinking how do we get started?
[27:55] First of all, I think we need to start maybe from a smaller region that's like urban city maybe localized solution versus like launching this around the world.
[28:07] So let's take San Francisco for example maybe Google can well Google knows where the user is right based on their Google map data.
[28:16] If I know that these people are based in San Francisco, I can target them and first have a notification showing that hey here's the beta idea for you to potentially monetize your spots if you have a parking spot if you're interested that's often right so we address that awareness issue sort of educating them through a first time user experience.
[28:38] So let's see if we know who would a target. Is it just everyone in San Francisco?
[28:44] That's a good question. I wonder okay so there's a few ideas right one is if if I'm an avan Google user.
[28:54] I have my Google home setup at home and it mills exactly my address and probably has an idea as to whether this area has like parking spots or not based on whether maybe Google view if it's like an outdoor one or
[29:06] Google reviews of the apartment complex then I know there's a parking garage already.
[29:11] Okay in the data there Google would have more confidence in terms of who might be a parking spot owner.
[29:18] Now we don't have to go that route either we can just block has to do entire San Francisco and have people within one time or two times.
[29:26] A little bit of a user distraction but hey doesn't need a product we're not launching to the whole world yet.
[29:31] Okay.
[29:32] So we have the awareness part down once people opt in the spot owner might have need might need to go through a first time setup flow basically entering the x y dimension of their parking spot and also the height of let's say the maximum height the garage can take.
[29:52] So there's information for partners looking to park.
[29:56] How much they want to charge potentially or even right there their payment information like the bank of information so they can get paid.
[30:05] And of course importantly when the spot might be available right we can indicate like Monday to Friday the supplies always recurring available between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
[30:16] So the owner drives out to work.
[30:20] And then if there's any sort of access.
[30:25] So if you're a player like whether they need a specific code to enter parking garage.
[30:29] From my garage uses a QR code so perhaps like we can scramble and generate new QR code every time.
[30:37] If that's access need.
[30:41] And then once that's set up you can have drivers and drivers coming in to park this spots.
[30:47] And then the important thing is to set up a process for them to show that hey the parking spot is being taken out by this car.
[30:55] So Google can use Google lands or have you just upload those photos into the system for this transaction to work.
[31:03] Yeah. And then lastly is just Google pay making sure that the payment system works.
[31:07] Yeah. And do you think here you to make it more automated the camera stuff you were talking about the bottom.
[31:13] Probably needs to be incorporated because people having to take a photo of like what would they take a photo of them not being in the spot.
[31:20] It's like okay it's free now. So yeah.
[31:23] About number one and three.
[31:27] So in terms of MVP I think number one would be fine if you trust users use your phone.
[31:33] If it's the parking spot owner they use your phone to take a photo of the parking spot right to show people hey this is a clean parking spot.
[31:41] It's big enough for example.
[31:43] I'm for the driver though they're maybe taking the photos for the first time of the car they're parking in that spot.
[31:49] So it shows that I park my car. This is my parking.
[31:52] It's my car driver license and perhaps when they leave this is a photo of what that spot looks like empty I guess.
[32:01] So you're not damaging the spot right for example I say okay.
[32:06] That's the MVP the hard way play would be like over time right if we showed at the MVP works then we can start renting out.
[32:15] So that's camera is developing hardware to make this user experience better as you hear just now that user experience a little bit.
[32:23] I see.
[32:27] And it goes into sort of that dispute pipeline right that maybe every MVP has for example and you have to pay me information so just any damage you can like again serve penalties.
[32:38] On top of that a lot of these if you're talking about an apartment complex I would imagine there's cameras already installed so if there is some dispute so you can actually check through the tape.
[32:51] Absolutely for structure.
[32:54] Awesome. All right good work. Let's end it there.
[32:59] Good work. So I want to talk through some of the strength and some of the opportunities in Austin's answer this is a great answer to this common question that's asked at top tech company like Google Facebook.
[33:10] So let's start with the strengths.
[33:12] So one I think this really stood out the first thing was just a solution that you came up with was very novel.
[33:19] It's taking in consideration the what do we call this economy the sharing economy.
[33:24] Right, but with parking. Yeah, this is pretty new.
[33:29] Right. And that is applying that concept which I think is a really creative solution.
[33:34] So was served well in his solutions part he had a combination of this is the more practical one and then the last one with the hardware play is the more beefed up moonshot version.
[33:45] So in a lot of these answers they want to see a PM can be able to think of both something that you can implement quickly and those that are more long term that could take three to five years.
[33:55] Awesome job there. The second big strength.
[33:59] Which I think inspired this idea that then when I've asked this question before people didn't come to.
[34:06] Was the user segments.
[34:08] Identifying this extra one of spot owners was very unique that then led Austin be able to get to the solution and the pain points that most people didn't get most people will stop at one two and three.
[34:19] So I think this was another area where Austin stood out here.
[34:23] All right, let's talk about opportunities.
[34:26] So also two opportunities I would pinpoint here.
[34:30] So what do you do in the user journey pain point section.
[34:36] So here he did a great job of calling out the user journey.
[34:40] Here this is contentious, but I usually say try to think of pain points that create pain versus needs.
[34:47] So I would have loved here some of these needs like desire to reach more people as to how do I frame that in what's painful today what's the obstacle.
[34:57] And example, he did that well is I'm unsure how to charge. So that sounds like a pain point.
[35:03] So again, not a deal breaker at all, but something I would have like to see.
[35:09] Yes, there's something I'm like struggle with, I believe.
[35:12] And sometimes the thing about it as in the past, I think about it as psychological needs, which is like the emotional needs and those functional needs.
[35:19] But I realize I can truly empathize it to pain.
[35:22] Then that helps us come up with better solutions as well. So yeah, things sort of.
[35:27] That's a good point. I always say at the end of the day, if you feel the emotional pain and frustration is when you.
[35:34] When it really clicks that, oh, now motivated to solve this.
[35:38] And that's why we always talk about user empathy.
[35:41] So the second opportunity area and the last one is around prioritization itself.
[35:46] And I think at maybe the pain points area, we have the different medium low.
[35:52] So Austin did a great job calling out the criteria.
[35:55] You always want to call out the criteria first to show that your data driven thinker.
[35:59] But maybe us walking us through why something was medium large, because at the end of the day, you really have to convince the interviewer.
[36:07] On why there's no existing solution by providing some examples of.
[36:12] Subpar solutions or that there really is none. So in this case, for example, there actually was some competing solutions here.
[36:19] And maybe even if the interviewer doesn't know of it.
[36:24] I think the interviewer might jump in and this is where you might have to consider.
[36:32] Okay, I've seen similar solutions.
[36:36] So I would say be careful in the prioritization portion in providing strong rationale and being open to be proven wrong.
[36:42] And this is the area where most people where the interviewer interjects the most.
[36:47] So I would practice this section.
[36:50] But overall great job and no surprise that Austin got the offer at meta.
[36:56] Austin, any last tips for the rest of the folks still striving to beat the interviews?
[37:02] Two things, lots of practice, of course.
[37:05] Keep mocking as many platforms to do that. You can mock with your friends and so forth.
[37:09] And through this, you can meet new people as well.
[37:11] The second thing that really helped me is watch to every single day of the video.
[37:16] Type down the notes.
[37:18] Really just type down notes as detail as possible.
[37:21] And then open chat GVT just use chat GVT.
[37:25] Prompt it to say like this is what I'm trying to do.
[37:28] I'm trying to manage our practice for practicing for interview and dump notes section by section and summarize seeing what.
[37:35] You know logic Diana uses to go through her interviews with multiple of them.
[37:40] I end up having a really good framework that guides me through.
[37:44] So for each interview, I just make sure that I go through that framework and understand why Diana uses these framework for.
[37:52] That is so impressive. So wait, so you dumped in the notes from the videos into chat GVT and then how did you use it?
[38:01] And then what do they take some time to prompt it back and forth.
[38:05] So for example, I for a product sense, I could just I just want to focus on how do I use a segment better.
[38:12] So you can just tell us how GVT like, hey, I want to practice segmenting user better.
[38:17] Here's the prompt. Here's how Diana segments a user and here's the why she segments.
[38:23] And you give multiple examples.
[38:26] Now ask it to hey, come up with a general structure on how I set how to set how to segment users and how to talk about it.
[38:33] Is it great tip?
[38:37] You can build the Diana chat by.
[38:41] I thought about it, but basically, hey, this cannot be done if there wasn't great initial data and like those came from your great YouTube videos.
[38:50] So happy to hear that. And again, so huge congrats on getting to offer since then Austin has moved to San Francisco.
[38:58] So I hope you're enjoying the job.
[39:01] And for others who are still like Austin mentioned lots of practice watching lots of videos.
[39:07] If you guys want to watch another video on product sense, take a look at this video where we have another folk.
[39:14] Someone else that got an offer at meadow going through product sense answering the question, what would you build in the travel space?
[39:20] Alright, and I'll see you guys later. Thank you Austin.
[39:23] Yes. Bye.
