[00:00] If you're trying to get a job as a product manager, you must have prepared for these top five
[00:05] most asked questions. In this video, I'm going to share some tips with you on the framework
[00:11] on how to tackle these questions, some sample questions, and mistakes that you want to avoid.
[00:18] So these are specifically product case interview type questions. So the first of most commonly
[00:25] asked question is the favorite product question. And that sounds like what is your favorite product
[00:32] and how would you improve it? And here's the six step framework you want to use to tackle this
[00:37] question. The first you want to identify a software product, a hardware product, or a physical
[00:43] product. So some examples of my favorite for software are apps like Too Good To Go for you
[00:49] Foodies, or hardware products like My RoboVac, or The Dishwasher because I cook a lot,
[00:55] and The Dishwasher saved me so many times, or physical product like the back scratcher. So you
[01:01] can choose any of those three products. You can even ask the interview to specify do they want
[01:07] you to choose one in any of the three domains. A common question that I get from my clients is
[01:13] what product should I pick? I would say pick a product that you actively told friends about
[01:19] because that means you've loved it enough to tell other people. And this can either be a product
[01:24] that's more well known like Uber, maybe you are obsessed with the Uber app, or one that's a bit
[01:29] more niche. So for example, my favorite product as someone who's really in the fitness that I've told
[01:35] tons of friends about is one called Fit On, a fitness app that was just saved me during COVID.
[01:41] So step number two, talk about the main goal of this product. What is it trying to accomplish?
[01:47] Step three, you want to talk about the users. Usually most products have two sides of the ecosystem
[01:53] or more. Step four, you want to talk about how this product specifically helps users accomplish
[02:00] the product goal. Step five is talking about pain points. And here you want to start actively
[02:06] answering the second part of the question, how would you improve this? And it starts with
[02:10] identifying, well, what are things that suck with the product today? So talk about some things that
[02:16] are really painful. And the last step is to come up with solutions that solve for those pain points.
[02:24] I covered this question in much more depth in this video that I'll link above covering, I told you,
[02:30] my favorite product, the Too Good to Go app. Mistakes that you want to avoid. I remember in college when
[02:36] I got this question interviewing with Yahoo, I started blabbing on about the product that I liked
[02:42] and things that I brand and assortment of things that I think they should fix. That is not what a
[02:48] great answer sounds like. They're not asking you to rant about your favorite product. Instead,
[02:54] they're asking for structured and strategic viewpoint on the product. So you might be wondering,
[03:02] what are they actually testing for? Two things. Number one, they're testing your strategic
[03:07] thinking. Things like, can you think big picture? Can you understand goals? Can you discuss trade-offs?
[03:14] When making decisions, you start with a criteria that's logical. The second thing they're
[03:19] testing for is product design. Can you empathize with users and design a great user experience
[03:25] with minimum friction? Can you create delightful experiences that users feel like there's a wow
[03:31] factor to your product? The second most asked question is the product improvement question.
[03:36] And it sounds something like, how would you improve a product like Spotify? How would you improve
[03:41] Google Maps? And the framework for this is kind of similar to the one we just talked about,
[03:47] except they're giving you a specific product rather than asking you to think about a product.
[03:52] So here, I actually recommend using the same framework as the one we just talked about above.
[03:58] So what are some mistakes to avoid? So some common questions I get about this question is,
[04:04] well, what if I'm not familiar with the product that they're asking me about? Your first attempt
[04:09] is to try to take a best guess. Sometimes the name of the product is exactly what it is. Other times,
[04:16] it's not super clear. For example, if someone was in a country where Spotify was not well known,
[04:23] it'd be hard to guess that it was a music app. So for those, you have no choice, but to ask the
[04:28] interviewer, can you tell me a little bit more about the product? I'm not super familiar. But note,
[04:34] if you're in the US and you're not familiar or had never heard of a product like Spotify,
[04:40] I don't know how well that's going to look on your behalf. So make sure to study up the top
[04:46] 10-20 most downloaded apps out there. You might even ask the interviewer, can I take a look at the
[04:51] product in real time on my phone? What should you avoid for these questions? Avoid someone to the
[04:57] last one, branding about features that you would wish this product has. Instead, you want to think
[05:05] strategically about what the product is trying to accomplish for its target users and solutions
[05:11] given those pain points. And make sure that those pain points are generalizable to a larger population
[05:17] than just yourself. This video was originally going to cover the top 10 most asked questions,
[05:22] but I would probably take more than 30 minutes. So I'm going to cover the next set of five questions
[05:27] in an upcoming video, so subscribe to make sure you don't miss that video. Question number three,
[05:33] that's most commonly asked, is the product design question. And it sounds like what product would
[05:38] you build for X? So some example questions that have been asked by companies like Google, Facebook,
[05:44] etc. What product would you build in the travel space? What product would you build to help people
[05:50] find roommates? So the structure for this is quite simple, but answering this question is not easy,
[05:56] so don't get fooled by the simple framework. It's a four-part framework, and the first part
[06:01] starts with why do we want to build for this problem? So for example, why do you want to build in the
[06:07] travel space? Why would a company want to invest in this? The second, who are the users in this space?
[06:13] So ecosystem-wide, but also who are the subset of users? Stack number three is think of pain points
[06:24] that these users might be suffering with in the travel space that you could build for, and make
[06:29] sure to prioritize which pain points you're going to go for. And step number four is the think of
[06:33] solutions for the prioritized target segment and the pain points for those user segments that you
[06:41] identified. Here's a link to an example question where I answer, what product would you build to help
[06:48] people buy and sell and teach? Funny side story that a friend told me was one time for his company,
[06:55] he asked an interviewee the question, what product would you build to help people get more pizza?
[07:02] And the candidate goes, I would build a pizza canyon, either that was pretty hilarious,
[07:08] so don't be afraid to infuse some humor in there because technically pizza canyon could get
[07:13] people more pizza. What are common mistakes to avoid for these type of questions is starting with
[07:19] the solution rather than the problem. I see a lot of candidates fall into this trap where they think,
[07:27] oh, travel space, something that I've always wanted to build or I think is cool would be a
[07:32] travel app to help people meet each other locally. And then they work backwards from the solution.
[07:38] Note for this question, it's never about the idea rather the process that you walk through to show
[07:45] the interviewer that you can think logically, structurally and that you have user empathy. They're
[07:50] not just looking for creative ideas, you can have the most creative ideas, but if you can't identify
[07:56] who the user segments are or their pain points, you're not going to succeed in this interview.
[08:01] The fourth most asked question in product interviews is a success metric question. And it sounds like
[08:08] what success metrics would you set for product X or sound something like what goals would you set
[08:16] for product X? So for example, some questions that have been asked in real interviews are what
[08:22] metrics would you set for the Uber Eats app? What metrics do you think Airbnb goals against?
[08:29] So how would you tackle this? Here's a five step framework to tackle this. The first one
[08:34] starting with understanding the product. So what does the product do? Who are the users?
[08:40] What are the users trying to accomplish? Step two is then qualitatively what do we want to measure
[08:47] to help us get a sense that this product is helping those users accomplish their goals and helping
[08:52] the business accomplish their goals? Step three is in translating those qualitative things into
[09:00] quantitative metrics. Step four is identifying let's say two to three North Star top metrics that you
[09:07] care about that you want to prioritize. And step five is to think of counter metrics and downstream
[09:16] metrics. If you're wondering how do I actually tackle this question? Here's a link to one of my
[09:21] most popular videos answering what metrics would you set for Airbnb? A common mistake that you
[09:28] want to avoid is listing a bunch of very generic metrics. So a lot of people tend to use certain
[09:35] metric frameworks like the Pirates framework R which stands for acquisition retention revenue, etc.
[09:44] So they're not necessarily wrong but they're pretty generic framework that people use to
[09:49] tackle any question which more so shows memorization than it actually shows thinking about the product.
[09:55] For example some common metrics I hear all the time when I interview clients is oh the key
[10:01] metric for this product is DAO, daily active users or monthly active users or time spent. So again
[10:08] it's not wrong like at companies we do measure those things but you want to show a bit more thought
[10:15] than just throwing the most commonly measured metrics. And even if you do call a metrics that are
[10:21] more often cited than not explain your thinking why Mao is important. So you might say something like
[10:28] for example for an app like Airbnb I might expect people to book travel somewhere around once a
[10:35] month or once every quarter and hence I want to measure something like monthly active users.
[10:40] So make it specific to the product you're talking about and not just throwing out generic metrics
[10:47] that show you know how to memorize versus think through the question. Question number five is the
[10:52] debugging root cause analysis question that sounds something like where's the metric why go down for
[10:59] product X what's going on and how would you fix it. An example question for this is where seeing the
[11:05] number of riders go down on Uber what's going on and how would you fix it. Here's your six part
[11:11] framework to tackle this type of question. You first start off with qualified questions like this
[11:16] metric went down in what time span was it the last couple days was it a month. Are we seeing these
[11:23] metrics localized suggest a specific region or globally. These questions are important because they
[11:29] help you understand what issues might be more likely to contribute towards this drop versus less
[11:36] likely. So you can eliminate options. Step number two is talking about the product basically what
[11:42] is the product do what is it. Step number three is then talking about the user flow how do people
[11:49] experience this product. How does this metric reflect a step in the user flow for users and what are
[11:56] the steps that are attributed to this metric. Number four is talking about hypotheses on why you think
[12:03] this metric might have dropped. Number five is answering the question how would you validate or
[12:08] invalidate certain hypotheses that you have. And step number six based on your prioritized list of
[12:13] hypotheses that you would go try to understand first or validate invalidate first. What are some
[12:19] solutions to solve for some of those hypotheses. I will link an example question in the video above
[12:25] answering we're seeing over cancellations go up what's going on. Now what are common mistakes
[12:33] that you want to avoid. So commonly when I ask this question most people go through a checklist
[12:39] of things they memorize of things that could go wrong. And you'll see a video where I cover a
[12:45] skit of the most common type of interaction that I see when I ask these questions in an interview.
[12:52] This isn't high school so you're not going to impress them by memorizing things. So think
[12:57] thoughtfully through the question and a framework I just shared above will almost force you to think
[13:02] versus memorize. So we have the five most commonly asked questions. The first one is the favorite
[13:07] product. Second is product improvement. Third is product design. Fourth is success metric and number
[13:14] five is debugging root cause analysis. A common question I get all the time is which is the toughest
[13:20] out of these five questions. I would say probably the toughest is the product design question. If you
[13:26] want to see an example where a real candidate that got an offer at Facebook tackle this question
[13:32] take a look at this video to see what is needed to pass these interviews. And I will see you guys
[13:40] in the next video.
