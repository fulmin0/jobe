[00:00] For the product sense interview question where you're asked design a product to help people find doctors
[00:06] A key step in solving this is identifying which users you want to build for by segmenting users
[00:14] Here's a framework and some unique tips to help you segment users that are less generic and that will help you stand out
[00:23] Hey guys, I'm Ziana and I'm a senior product manager at a big tech company in Silicon Valley, California
[00:32] And I bring you the best tips to get into product management and teach you how to succeed once you've made it
[00:39] So the three things I'm going to be covering to help you segment users better is the one map out the ecosystem
[00:48] Two, I'm going to share some tips on segmenting and three
[00:52] I'll teach you how to prioritize a segment you want to build for and we're going to use the question
[00:58] Design a product to help people find doctors
[01:02] The first step is mapping the ecosystem
[01:05] You want to show the interviewer that you have a big picture understanding of the ecosystem and how the end users
[01:13] Are related to that stakeholders so in this example question
[01:17] What is the ecosystem of finding doctors in the US the stakeholders range from the doctors who are part of
[01:25] Hospitals or association or private clinics and then you have the insurance companies and then you have the patient a key tip here
[01:33] It's most times product sense and product design questions
[01:37] Why don't you build something for the end user but here
[01:41] It's really important to make sure you understand the incentives of the players in the ecosystem
[01:48] Because if the incentives are misaligned
[01:50] It'll be really hard to drive adoption for the product to I'm going to share some tips for segmenting a
[01:58] Straight forward way to help you come up with user segments is asking yourself
[02:03] Who are the most frequent users and the least frequent users trying to accomplish this task?
[02:10] Think about the extremes in this spectrum for example
[02:15] Here the most frequent users trying to find doctors are probably those with chronic illnesses like cancer or with rare diseases
[02:25] Who need to go from multiple tasks multiple consults?
[02:29] The least frequent users are those who are going for their yearly checkup and along the spectrum are patients
[02:37] Who might need an extra consult from a specialty doctor to double check something to prevent any chronic illnesses
[02:45] Comment below if I'm missing other user segments that you can think of here's the checklist
[02:50] You can have in your back pocket to help you determine whether you use this segment is good or not the first thing on this
[02:57] checklist segmenting by behavior is better than demographics many candidates will default to segmenting by age
[03:06] Or in this case they would segment by saying
[03:08] Kids who would adoptors adults and then senior people. It's not wrong
[03:13] It's pretty generic the second thing on this checklist is to be me see
[03:20] mutually exclusive
[03:21] comprehensively
[03:23] Which means for the mutually exclusive part you want to make sure that your groups don't have a huge overlap between them in this case
[03:32] people who have a chronic illness
[03:35] Probably aren't the ones who only need one checkup yearly
[03:39] They're probably going to the doctor multiple times and comprehensively
[03:43] Exhaustive means you want to cover as much of the population as possible
[03:48] But I would say 80% is good enough. Don't worry about the edge cases
[03:54] The third thing on your checklist is to avoid niche for big tech companies
[03:59] They're most likely optimizing a bill something for as many people as possible and the fourth thing on your checklist is
[04:07] Different pain points which means you want to choose segments who have noticeably different pain points
[04:13] For example people who have chronic illnesses will have the pain point of needing specialty doctors of which there's a very limited supply
[04:23] Especially if you have a rare disease where as people who are going for their yearly checkup and are looking for generalist doctors
[04:30] We have a plentiful of supply to choose from who probably don't have to spend as much as finding a doctor who's in a niche
[04:39] The third step I'm going to teach you how to figure out which segments to prioritize
[04:45] Let's borrow from the venture capital industry
[04:48] These are organizations that invest in tech companies and they usually optimize for a couple criteria
[04:55] For example, the first one is total addressable market
[04:58] Which plainly means the number of people being affected and usually tech companies want to optimize
[05:04] For building products that affect millions if not billions of people a second criteria is frequency of use or
[05:12] Engagement tech companies want to build something people are using regularly not just once a year
[05:17] The third criteria is building for an underserved
[05:21] population because that helps you not have to compete with the existing players out there who are serving the same population
[05:29] And the fourth is spend understanding which customers have the highest revenue potential because
[05:36] Let's not kid ourselves tech companies are there to make money to
[05:40] How do you want to use this is picking two to three criteria that you want to optimize for
[05:45] Then for each segment
[05:48] Score it from one to five with five being the highest and then multiply the numbers across the criteria
[05:55] To help you figure out which of the segments have the highest possible impact
[06:00] You'll see my example here where identify
[06:03] Three user segments that I could be prioritizing between and you'll see at the top
[06:08] My three criteria is that I want to optimize for in this case a total addressable market
[06:13] Frequency of use and spend and you'll see I'm giving each of them a score and the score is
[06:21] Relative to each other which means for spend I come over the score by comparing the chronic illness group with the group that needs specialty doctors
