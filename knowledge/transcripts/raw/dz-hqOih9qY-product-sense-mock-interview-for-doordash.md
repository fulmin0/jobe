## Transcript

[00:00] So, Yoon, how would we fix Airbnb's worst post booking experience?
[00:06] Hi, everyone. I'm Diana.
[00:07] One of your favorite PM coaches.
[00:09] Today, I have Yoon here who is going to go through a door dash question with us.
[00:13] So do you want to give a short intro?
[00:15] Yeah. Hello, everybody. My name's Yoon.
[00:18] I was a PM at Microsoft and another AI company.
[00:21] I recently joined the door dash.
[00:24] Huge, congrats, Yoon.
[00:26] Not many people pass the reviews.
[00:28] So she was gracious enough today to give you guys a snippet because her big
[00:33] pain point was not being able to find much information from the door dash.
[00:37] Yeah.
[00:38] Yeah. That was it was hard to prepare that interview.
[00:42] Hopefully, it could be helpful for everyone here.
[00:44] And she made it.
[00:45] So today, we're going to have her excellence to show us the way to tackle this
[00:51] question, which is Yoon.
[00:54] Let's say you're a PM on Airbnb.
[00:57] How might be fixed the worst post booking experience Airbnb?
[01:03] I have one minute to organize my thoughts first.
[01:06] Of course, unless they kept a bulletin, that's how I'm going to start talking about the interview.
[01:13] The question, I will start talking about the product, try to understand what is Airbnb,
[01:18] what the users and how they make money.
[01:21] And then go through the metrics, pick one of the metrics that will be our North Sun
[01:28] metrics to evaluate these questions.
[01:31] And then go to the user journey, or we call it how it works, to understand the whole process.
[01:39] And then from that, it would just be easier for me to go through that first and then find the
[01:45] pain points during that journey.
[01:48] And we'll protest them based on some criteria that picked.
[01:53] And then maybe pick one to use the pain point to go to the solution space.
[01:59] Does that sounds good?
[02:00] Fantastic.
[02:01] And then I'll be asking follow questions along the way.
[02:03] So if you can take positive route.
[02:04] Yeah.
[02:05] Awesome.
[02:06] Sounds good.
[02:07] So yeah, so let's get started.
[02:10] For Airbnb, I think most people don't know it.
[02:15] It's a marketplace for owners to rent their places.
[02:20] So the guests can stay for their trip.
[02:22] And guests can find the place that they want to stay during their trip.
[02:27] And it's different than the hotels.
[02:29] It's more like a homey experience and more local homey.
[02:34] And I used it before like when I was going to Hawaii that I don't want to stay in the hotel.
[02:41] It's super expensive.
[02:43] And also I want to have some friends to make some friends while I was there.
[02:49] I think many people kind of do that way.
[02:52] For while we talk about that, what is the Airbnb?
[02:55] We also mentioned about the users, the user segments for NDB.
[03:02] There are two user segments I would say.
[03:04] Maybe let's say one we call that host, who is the owner of the house,
[03:11] and they rent the places out.
[03:14] Another is called that is the guest, like new books of places to stay.
[03:20] And because the Airbnb is a third party of this whole platform,
[03:26] they themselves want to make money.
[03:29] And the business model, I like to mention here a little bit,
[03:34] so that will impact the mattress I pick later.
[03:37] How Airbnb makes money is based on the charging fees for every of the transactions.
[03:43] We book nights or book experience there, the charge fees for each of the charge certain fees
[03:50] for each of the transactions.
[03:53] And that leads us to the mattress.
[03:56] What mattress I want to pick for this whole problem that we're supposed to booking experience.
[04:04] I'll have you brainstorm a couple and then maybe tell me which one you would prioritize.
[04:10] Okay, sounds good. Give me a second to think about all the mattress I should pick.
[04:14] I'll write down three metrics here while I was thinking about what mattress we can pick.
[04:21] The number one is the number of nice books and stayed per day, which I mean here,
[04:26] they successfully checking and stayed at that place.
[04:30] Not just booked and then some reason you didn't go.
[04:34] I don't think that should count.
[04:36] The reason I pick this one is I think this is a North Star for Airbnb
[04:42] because this is an intersection of all three parties, the host, gas and Airbnb.
[04:48] A host gets value when people booked the nice air, they make the money.
[04:53] And the guests get the value, they find a good place for them to stay.
[04:57] So they get the value when the night is booked and stayed.
[05:00] And for course, of course, and we get the value because they make money for every transaction
[05:07] for every state. And I know they really care about this number of nights in their
[05:12] lot of reports. They keep talking about how they're growing.
[05:15] The decent number of nice books, they're really important to them.
[05:20] For retention, I usually think about retention, maybe retention for this problem.
[05:26] But I find it's really hard to use the retention here.
[05:31] Here's my reason. One of customer has bad experience.
[05:36] The impact is they might don't come back for a book another trip.
[05:40] Use Airbnb to book another trip.
[05:42] But it's hard to measure because you're not using as a person like me.
[05:50] I might go travel twice a year, but some people might travel once a year or some people might travel
[05:57] even less frequent. So if they don't come back in, let's say in a year, you can't say it's because
[06:04] they have a bad experience there. It might be just they're not traveling that frequent.
[06:09] Or it might be the places they go, they don't have Airbnb there.
[06:15] They have more hotel choices there.
[06:18] So they end up choosing hotel other than Airbnb.
[06:23] So I found the retention is really hard to measure here.
[06:27] So I'm not going to pick this one.
[06:29] I also think about using rating as a metrics here, but I also find it not that
[06:36] right to be used here. Because not everybody gives the ratings.
[06:41] Normally, you have very good experience or very bad experience.
[06:49] The very extreme experiences and then you give rating.
[06:52] Most of people just lay there not with ratings.
[06:55] So I find that ratings might not be a good metrics here either.
[07:00] So let's go with number of nights booked.
[07:03] Yeah, okay, sounds good.
[07:05] Here's the user journey of using Airbnb.
[07:07] I cover both sides of the host and the guests.
[07:11] Yeah, let's take a look at the pain points.
[07:13] I feel free to take it up 30 seconds.
[07:15] Yeah, so I will work on the pain form for both of the parties.
[07:20] I think this whole journey covers both of the parties.
[07:24] And yeah, give me 30 seconds.
[07:27] Sounds good.
[07:28] Thank you.
[07:37] And the things we're talking about post the booking experience.
[07:40] And I'm going to only talk about the pain points I post the booking.
[07:45] Yeah, all right.
[07:46] Thanks.
[07:47] Thanks.
[07:47] That's good.
[08:10] Okay, I'm ready to talk about the pain points.
[08:18] So let's say pain points for guests and hosts.
[08:23] For guests, I'm thinking about post the booking,
[08:26] whether the things can happen that go wrong.
[08:32] One thing is cancellation that charges a high fee.
[08:35] If you want to change your plan,
[08:37] sometimes they don't let you cancel or if you cancel,
[08:40] you have to charge a high fee like that.
[08:43] That's painful when you, that's painful when you don't have that budget for that.
[08:50] And hard to find the place.
[08:52] I had one time, like I was, as I mentioned, I was in Maui.
[08:57] That place was in her middle of some forest.
[09:03] So actually it takes me a while to find that place.
[09:06] And there was no information about it on the Airbnb,
[09:11] on the Airbnb, like the detail page.
[09:15] I had to kind of like navigated myself.
[09:18] And the Google doesn't work very well there.
[09:22] And then the second problem, it's the third problem can happen is you can't check in.
[09:28] It can be multiple reasons like there's no room available.
[09:32] Like when there was no room available.
[09:36] And it happened to me once that I booked the Airbnb with my friends.
[09:42] And I didn't really look for the confirmation email.
[09:46] I saw it was just down.
[09:47] You know, I booked it and I saw it was down.
[09:50] But when I got there, I can't get into the apartment.
[09:52] So I was looking for some information to get to the apartment.
[09:55] But there's no information.
[09:57] So I had to call the host.
[09:59] And finally, I found the host.
[10:01] And the host is like, oh, I haven't done Airbnb for a while.
[10:05] Like my room, it's not available.
[10:09] So that messed up my whole trip there.
[10:12] It was very hard to find another room.
[10:16] Immediately at that moment, we already got there and I had to change all my plans.
[10:22] And sometimes the key doesn't work or the password doesn't work.
[10:26] You have to contact customer service or host to get that right.
[10:31] And during stay, their multiple things can be wrong.
[10:36] You finally got your space.
[10:38] But then you find out all the place doesn't look as nice as what if it's advertised.
[10:44] Advertised the picture always nicer.
[10:47] And you might find some of their supplies or equipment not working.
[10:51] Like maybe the refrigerator is not working.
[10:53] That can be a big problem.
[10:55] Or the toilet is not flashing.
[10:57] Yeah, that's annoying.
[11:00] And the since Airbnb is not the same as a hotel.
[11:04] They have people cleaning, but it might not be that professional cleaning as a hotel.
[11:10] So sometimes people complain, this is the place is not that clean.
[11:17] And depends on location.
[11:18] Some location, since you as a first time you got there, you might feel like neighborhood
[11:23] that's not that safe.
[11:26] It's a new place for you.
[11:27] And if something looks kind of scary, the neighborhood might feel like I don't want to go out.
[11:32] You kind of just want to stay there and you're concerned about the safety issue.
[11:38] And safety concern can be another saying that when you share the place with other people,
[11:44] some people put their Airbnb to share the place with a host or other rumies who are traveling.
[11:53] You don't know them.
[11:55] It's the first time I've ever met you don't know who they are, what they do.
[12:01] And your door might not be that secure.
[12:04] It might not be security locked.
[12:08] So you might be concerned about my stuff being stolen or it can happen to somebody.
[12:14] Maybe there's stuff really got stolen or damaged by other people.
[12:19] And sometimes you do have to contact a host for something.
[12:27] There's no direct,
[12:32] so there's no guarantee they will respond.
[12:35] And most of the time the host left all the papers about all the instructions in the room.
[12:42] But if you need help, so it can't be frustrated when the hosts are not responding.
[12:52] Another extreme example can be dangerous accident.
[12:55] Like there's a fire, there's a gas leak happening in the house.
[13:01] That can't really make up the trip.
[13:04] No, everything.
[13:05] Pretty extreme.
[13:06] Okay.
[13:07] But yeah, that's four of six reasons that would make the news.
[13:10] Yeah.
[13:12] And last one, bad customer service.
[13:15] Like, it can be you have some issues, but you try to find customer service to help, but it's not working.
[13:21] That's also bad experience.
[13:23] I also listed a couple here for two for the hosts before we go prioritize them.
[13:29] And I quickly talked about that.
[13:32] For the hosts, I think the host booking experience, they already have their places
[13:37] that are up there.
[13:38] So I'm not going to talk about that.
[13:40] I can signal to is why is the customers make some damage to the house?
[13:46] It can be a small damage for some small items, but it can be big damages as well.
[13:54] And another issue is lake checkout.
[13:58] If the previous customer check out late and then you don't have that much cleaning time
[14:03] and then in my mess up, you're nested guest to check in time.
[14:07] You might leave bad impressions or bad reviews about the cause of that.
[14:13] Yeah, any question here before we go prioritization?
[14:16] No, you were really exhaustive and spoke to a lot of my experiences that have happened once or twice.
[14:23] Amazing.
[14:23] So I'll have you prioritize, maybe instead of going through the whole list, just for time,
[14:29] what maybe feels like the top three and then within the top three, talk me through
[14:34] how you're thinking about the problem.
[14:37] Yeah, I feel friends good.
[14:39] 30 seconds or a minute.
[14:41] Okay, give me one minute to think about that because there's many pain points here.
[15:06] First of all, I would like to talk about my criteria that I prioritize then.
[15:19] I would like to prioritize them by pain level, how painful it is, the impact on the mattress
[15:26] which we picked before was a number of nice foot.
[15:30] Okay, and the frequency how often it happens.
[15:34] And I would rate them by low media, low media height for each of them.
[15:43] Since we don't have time to go through all those, I quickly went through all the lists here
[15:48] and I would like to talk about this three as my top three problem that I think they are.
[15:56] The reason I picked this three is, I think they are quite serious.
[16:06] There's more painful ones that can happen.
[16:09] So we're going to talk about one by one.
[16:12] So no room available, that's very painful.
[16:17] I think that's the highest pain point here.
[16:19] You don't have a fight to stay, right?
[16:21] Of all the pain points here, the rate this one as the highest pain point.
[16:25] Others you have a place to stay, it's just something that's not working, but this one has the
[16:32] biggest pain. You don't have a pain room.
[16:35] And if you go book a room right now to go some other places, you might don't have a place
[16:41] fun immediately.
[16:42] Or it can be extremely expensive if you book last a minute.
[16:48] I think that's the biggest pain point here.
[16:50] And this no key or password, this one is painful because you might not be able to get in,
[16:58] but while reading media is because normally you can't find a way to solve that problem.
[17:03] Like you can contact the host or customer service to get that problem solved.
[17:08] It might take some time, but eventually I believe it should be solved.
[17:13] And places now claim it's kind of annoying.
[17:16] You won't have a place.
[17:18] It's painful.
[17:20] Everybody I think everyone put the first nice place, but I would say this
[17:26] a compares all of all the pain points and he's kind of not the highest pain point here.
[17:34] And then thinking, what about all the same concerns?
[17:39] Those also feel like there's the potential that could lead to you have a room,
[17:45] but it's not really stable, like whether it's dangerous accident, it's not safe.
[17:52] Yeah, I think about the safety, I would rate them like media for maybe the pain level,
[18:00] similar as the place they're not clean.
[18:04] Because you have that concern, but it's not like bad things going to happen to you for sure.
[18:13] You have that point.
[18:15] You have a place to stay.
[18:16] You feel a kind of neighborhood is not safe, but it's not like a bad thing is going to happen on you.
[18:23] It might still be fun, but you might have that concern.
[18:27] So it blocks you, prevent you coming back to Airbnb to book again.
[18:33] So I will rate the impact on matches as media.
[18:36] But frequency wise, I would also rate it kind of like a media wise.
[18:40] It's not or maybe or I'm saying low, maybe low or media.
[18:46] It's not that frequent like you find a place that's that bad.
[18:52] Normally you will like stay there as a place that you reviewed it before.
[18:58] You think it's good to play to stay.
[19:00] So I don't think it's that big surprise.
[19:03] Normally that happens.
[19:04] Oh, I booked this place and then the place is totally seems like such a bad neighborhood.
[19:10] Something like that.
[19:12] Yeah, there's a most time.
[19:14] Look at that beforehand.
[19:15] So they know whether they're looking a place that's safe or not safe.
[19:19] Yeah, they kind of have that expectation already.
[19:22] If they choose a kind of maybe an area like that,
[19:26] maybe cheaper or for some other reason, they stay there.
[19:31] And so another one is the impact on the metrics.
[19:34] Like how bad it will impact the number of nights booked.
[19:40] I rate this no room available as high as because this is the direct impact.
[19:46] Like if I don't have a room available right now,
[19:49] then it does not have one of the nights booked and stay.
[19:53] Right?
[19:53] That's the number one thing we're looking at.
[19:57] And also it will prevent you again coming back to Airbnb and book another trip again.
[20:02] Like you don't trust MBB anymore.
[20:04] You think, oh, I booked there and I go there.
[20:06] There's no room available.
[20:08] And next time when you go travel again,
[20:11] I don't think you're going to choose there Airbnb.
[20:13] You say, oh, I want to stay there.
[20:15] That's like, I think that's the highest pain points there.
[20:17] That's the highest impact on the number of nights booked.
[20:21] Right?
[20:22] And others, I think this one, I kind of rate it immediately.
[20:26] Or maybe it can be higher.
[20:27] It's like, unless this password totally not working,
[20:31] you can't figure it out the right way to get into the house.
[20:36] And then it does not contain a number of nights stay booked and stay.
[20:41] But if it works somehow, you eventually get that work,
[20:46] you still can stay this time.
[20:48] But you might be feeling like, oh, it's so much work to check in.
[20:52] Next time I don't choose Airbnb.
[20:57] So I kind of rate it as a media impact on the future on number of nights booked.
[21:02] And for others, places not clean,
[21:05] I think it depends on how bad it is,
[21:10] how bad the cleanness situation is.
[21:12] If it's some line of a little bit not clean, you're kicking about it,
[21:17] you might still feel okay, you can still choose Airbnb next time.
[21:23] But if it's so bad, you might not choose Airbnb next time.
[21:28] So kind of balancing out the old media.
[21:32] My third criteria is frequency,
[21:35] but I would maybe weigh it to less in this problem.
[21:39] Because we were talking about the worst post booking experience.
[21:44] I would think like the room, no room available.
[21:48] It probably happened not that often.
[21:50] So I rate it as low.
[21:53] But maybe I say overall there's only one percent of users have that problem.
[22:01] But the overall one percent of the user can be still a large amount of user.
[22:07] Because Airbnb has a large user group.
[22:10] So I would weight less of overall criteria.
[22:16] So based on that, I would think if I only pick one of the pain points there,
[22:21] for the gas side, I will probably still pick this no room available.
[22:26] It's not the worst supposed booking experience that can happen.
[22:30] Because it has the biggest pain level and has the biggest impact on the
[22:35] measures that number of nights booked.
[22:37] Even though it happens less frequency, but it's still a large user group
[22:41] that we should still focus on that.
[22:43] Okay, does that make sense to you, Diana?
[22:46] Yeah, that makes sense.
[22:47] The rationale was very thorough.
[22:50] Yeah, we didn't get to prioritize the hosts.
[22:53] What do we think?
[22:55] How do we think they measure up on the criteria that you shared?
[22:59] Yeah, so what are the two pain points here?
[23:04] I didn't mention them in my top three pain points overall.
[23:09] I kind of feel like this, for example, the damage thing, I kind of feel like it's maybe
[23:14] media, like kind of pain point level.
[23:19] Because it depends on how bad the damage.
[23:23] If it's kind of small damage, they can still pick.
[23:26] The hosts will probably still put their places on Airbnb.
[23:31] Unless it's like such, it's a very bad kind of damage.
[23:36] And then they can't, they were like a so frustrated about Airbnb users.
[23:41] Most users are not, I don't think that will be that bad normally.
[23:46] And also the frequency will be pretty low.
[23:50] So I didn't take this as my top pain points.
[23:55] And then later, check out, it can be, it's sometimes it can be okay because you might
[24:01] don't have the second day booked.
[24:04] You still have the time to clean it up.
[24:07] Or sometimes it might have some impact.
[24:11] Mess up your schedule that you have to quickly clean up for the nest, I guess.
[24:16] But I don't think overall it's that painful.
[24:19] Maybe the pain level I will rate it like low or media depends on the situation.
[24:26] And then I don't think that will prevent the host to continue
[24:35] host there of places on Airbnb.
[24:38] It's just a late check out.
[24:40] They think that user has a problem.
[24:41] They don't think it's that bad.
[24:43] Normally they don't think that bad to continue renting their places on Airbnb.
[24:49] So I think maybe, and the frequency may be low or medium.
[24:53] So that's why I didn't mention them as my top three other pain points.
[24:58] All right.
[24:58] Let's go to solutions for no room available.
[25:01] So yeah, take a sec.
[25:04] Then we give me 30 seconds to think about solutions.
[25:09] All right.
[25:09] Sounds good.
[25:34] Ready.
[25:34] I've got a couple options here.
[25:36] A couple ideas here.
[25:38] And I just wanted to reiterate the pain.
[25:41] So no room available.
[25:42] It's those cases when you had booked something and thought it was available.
[25:47] But it ended up not being available when you showed up or something like that.
[25:50] Yeah.
[25:51] When you showed up, you found out there's no room.
[25:54] There's no place for you to stay that day.
[25:56] So it's very bad experience.
[25:59] It's kind of a big, it's pain point.
[26:01] So I will think those solutions here,
[26:04] I was thinking, I cannot bucket them into two buckets.
[26:10] Why is the how to prevent that happening?
[26:13] Another bucket is, why didn't it really happen?
[26:17] What we do?
[26:19] Because you can't make everything perfect, right?
[26:22] But then if you can make up for it,
[26:24] the user can still be happy and they might still choose air believes.
[26:27] Like, oh, their customer service is so good.
[26:29] I can.
[26:30] I feel like air maybe even though that happens, right?
[26:34] So to prevent happens, I have one idea here is,
[26:38] based on my personal experience,
[26:40] the host was not active on air maybe.
[26:43] Somehow he didn't remove the listing there and I can still book it.
[26:47] So I think it can be some
[26:51] the regular check.
[26:52] We can check if based on some much,
[26:55] like we can use machine learning to check some of the host.
[26:59] If that is active or inactive,
[27:00] like this, this host have any conversation with customers in the last
[27:06] amount, is there anything change?
[27:08] Any editing based on all those things,
[27:11] we can see if this host is active or inactive host.
[27:14] And if we define some inactive host,
[27:16] we can delete those listing so prevent that happening.
[27:20] Maybe I also think another one like to prevent that happening.
[27:24] I can also check that like what we call
[27:27] confirmation check with the guest.
[27:31] Like you book that, what I mean is you,
[27:35] the host, the guest book that plays,
[27:38] you make that reservation.
[27:40] But like me, I never know,
[27:42] I never look it up.
[27:44] So if this is, I got confirmation or something like that.
[27:48] So there can be some reminder or confirmation sent from Airbnb,
[27:54] just say, hey, you book that place.
[27:58] But there's no confirmation or there's things
[28:02] something wrong.
[28:03] Like you want to double check or something like that.
[28:05] If the host has not been responding for a while,
[28:09] and then Airbnb can send that confirmation or reminder
[28:13] to the guest to prevent that happening.
[28:16] And so that's my first bucket.
[28:18] A second bucket, when it happens, what can we do?
[28:21] I have a couple ideas here.
[28:23] First one I think is like, you don't have a place to stay right now.
[28:27] You have to find another place to stay.
[28:29] And your Airbnb should have other Airbnb places to stay.
[28:35] So the guests should have priority to,
[28:38] you know, like a book place nearby that for sure,
[28:42] you're guaranteed that places, you find some places nice nearby.
[28:46] Even though maybe cost a higher price,
[28:49] but Airbnb should cover that cost or something like that.
[28:53] For the people, for the guests.
[28:56] And then another place is another idea is,
[28:59] if we don't have enough Airbnb places nearby in this location,
[29:05] let's say we're in a location that's not that many listings,
[29:10] it can be with partners with hotels.
[29:14] Hotels normally has more options there
[29:18] that you offer them free hotels at staying at this place.
[29:23] And that can be partnership with some hotel chains.
[29:27] So make sure you got good Friday of hotel options.
[29:34] So you guess you can choose where they want to stay.
[29:38] Another one here, it's kind of,
[29:40] they're really fun to try that partner with RVs or camping bands.
[29:45] Because the people who are booking Airbnb,
[29:47] a lot of them are kind of adventurous,
[29:51] they want to experience different places.
[29:57] If you offer them RVs or can't do bands,
[30:00] like a total different experience, but fun and unique,
[30:05] they might end up like wow,
[30:07] the Airbnb is so fun and it's interesting.
[30:11] So they might have that totally changed their mindset of Airbnb
[30:17] with a low room available.
[30:18] And then do something like this is fun.
[30:21] So I think that's something also Airbnb can try
[30:24] or they can try something like,
[30:26] I know they're trying doing something like called
[30:28] Icon that Airbnb own the places.
[30:33] They make that places a very unique experience
[30:36] and they build houses like that,
[30:39] a totally different experience.
[30:40] The idea here is similar,
[30:42] they offer something very cool unique to the guests
[30:47] with priority, like you have to offer them a places.
[30:52] So yeah, any questions here, Thayna?
[30:54] Yeah, no, no questions.
[30:56] I like the preventative versus kind of posts.
[30:59] They're bound to happen no matter how much we try to prevent them.
[31:03] Yeah, they're the solid list of solutions.
[31:05] Okay, let's leave it.
[31:06] Awesome.
[31:07] Amazing.
[31:08] Awesome.
[31:09] Thank you.
[31:10] We're going through this question.
[31:13] Again, there's not much information out there
[31:15] for you folks that are going to be interviewing with DoorDash.
[31:18] So you and provided one, what was stellar about this interview
[31:21] was the structure.
[31:23] Not only did she walk us through the structure in the beginning,
[31:26] but in each section, it was very clear
[31:28] what her decision criteria was going to be upfront.
[31:32] Even for the solutions, she said,
[31:34] we have preventative versus post
[31:36] if this happens solutions.
[31:38] So just throughout, it is very, very easy to follow.
[31:41] The second thing that's true.
[31:42] Thank you.
[31:43] Yeah.
[31:45] The second thing that stood out was your user empathy.
[31:47] As we went through the story in the pain points,
[31:50] you talked about your Maui trip,
[31:51] you talked about how frustrating would be for certain guests,
[31:54] and you use that to prioritize as well.
[31:56] So that was really helpful to show
[31:59] to DoorDash that you can get into the shoes of a user
[32:03] and thoroughly feel their pain
[32:05] to be that all-star PM to predict the pain
[32:09] of these potential customers ahead of time
[32:12] and a solve for that.
[32:14] Yeah, have the company take responsibility for that
[32:17] because what they're going to be doing is
[32:19] by doing that, for example,
[32:21] you had the solution of,
[32:23] oh, booking them another Airbnb on the Airbnb's cost.
[32:28] Right, this is a way to show
[32:29] that companies are investing in these customers long-term.
[32:33] Yeah.
[32:33] Yeah.
[32:35] So amazing work, you know.
[32:37] Thank you.
[32:38] Thank you.
[32:40] Any last words?
[32:40] We're here at the end for the guests.
[32:44] No, I think I have had a great experience with Diana.
[32:48] I really appreciate her insight.
[32:51] That was very helpful.
[32:53] And I hope everyone can find this helpful as well
[32:57] to make your job hunting journey a little bit easier.
[33:01] It's going to be one of the few videos online
[33:05] on DoorDash interviews, so don't worry.
[33:07] That's a fine to you.
[33:09] Thank you all.
[33:10] Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[33:12] Thank you, everyone.
[33:13] Bye.
