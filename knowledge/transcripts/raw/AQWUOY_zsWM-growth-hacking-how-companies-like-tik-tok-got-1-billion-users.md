[00:00] Growth hacking has helped companies like Facebook and TikTok grow to millions of users in a very
[00:06] short span of years. So in this video, we're going to uncover eight product growth tactics that
[00:11] are going to help you grow your product to millions of users. Starting with the foundations or the
[00:18] first principles of growth hacking. Secondly, we're going to dive into a framework for growth.
[00:25] And third, we're going to talk through some examples so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:30] So let's talk through some statistics to show you how certain companies really unleash the power of
[00:36] growth. So if we look at Facebook as an example, in around less than a year, they grew to over a million
[00:44] users. And around six years, they grew to 600 million users. Another great example is TikTok,
[00:52] where in less than five years, they overtook some of the most famous social media apps,
[00:58] including Instagram, et cetera, and grew to a billion users over a billion users. So sure,
[01:05] there was a lot of virality going on for the social media products, but also a lot of product
[01:10] growth tactics that you might not have even noticed. So we're going to be talking about some of
[01:15] those hidden product growth tactics that you might have been targeted for, but not even notice
[01:21] you fell for it. But first, we're going to start off with first principles of product growth that
[01:26] you need to know even before you start your growth efforts. With number one is start with product
[01:33] market fit before you start growing. Hence, you might ask what in the world is product market fit
[01:40] even? Well, qualitatively, product market fit is when you have a size of population that needs
[01:46] loves, wants, and is obsessed with your product. But you might ask, how do I even measure that?
[01:52] Well, a survey is a great way. So surveying a ton of your customers to get a generalizable
[01:58] population that says they need your product could be a good way to give you the indication that
[02:04] your product has a market. A great example is an email product called superhuman, where they help
[02:10] optimize your email tools so that you could spend less time answering emails and more time doing
[02:14] real work. And the CEO, Rahul Bora, talks about how he was able to use a survey, basically asked
[02:21] the question to his users, how sad would you be if you couldn't use superhuman tomorrow? And he kept
[02:27] building certain features and iterating and after building those lot of features, he would ask that
[02:32] question again. And as users reported that there'd be more sad or more users reported, they would
[02:39] be sad. The more confident that Rahul had that he had something that had product market fit.
[02:44] Quantitatively, how could you measure if you have product market fit? Well, if you can show in
[02:50] the data that you have users still using your product after X days, that is a good sign.
[02:56] Scientifically, we would call that looking at retention curves and having a non-zero retention
[03:02] rate after X number of days. On the X axis is the number of days on the Y axis shows you the
[03:10] percentage of users that are still using your product. And here are some examples of good
[03:15] retention curves and some examples of bad retention curves. Basically, users signing up and forgetting
[03:22] about the product or the product is not useful anymore after a certain number of days. A common
[03:27] question that people ask, especially product leaders, is, well, what's a good retention rate?
[03:34] And here, if you've just Google online, there is no benchmark that sits across all. But I have
[03:41] found some useful benchmarks from some leaders in the growth world such as Andrew Chen, who say that
[03:47] if you're able to hit greater than a 30% retention rate after a year, that's a pretty good number.
[03:54] Again, it'll depend on what type of product you have. So here's a couple of examples of different
[03:59] mobile apps and their retention rates. Again, on a blog article showed by Andrew Chen. So the
[04:04] combination of qualitative and quantitative understanding and measurement of product market fit
[04:10] will give you some semblance whether you have it before you start growing. The second principle
[04:16] foundational growth hacking is growth is a game of inches. Sure. Some experiments you run on
[04:23] growth will leave you with 1% of a jump. And you might look at it and say, if that's so insignificant,
[04:29] that didn't work. Not necessarily. Why? Because of a couple of principles, basically, it seems tiny,
[04:37] but with the compounding effect, 1% on top of 1% on top of 1%, will give you ginormous gains over time.
[04:46] Or another fact that comes in play here is the synergistic effect that the combination of different
[04:52] growth tactics will basically equate to the sum ending up to be greater than the individual
[05:01] components. And what's important about growth is that you're trying to learn the levers through
[05:08] experiments that work and don't work. And hence, some things will give you 1%, some things will
[05:13] give you 5%, and you're basically testing these different levers so that in the future, you're
[05:19] able to understand the effects and what size the effects have. And the third first principle of growth
[05:27] is balances key, which means you don't want to give up long-term success for short-term wins.
[05:36] So imagine this. In a short term, any product team can spam its users to try to increase engagement
[05:45] and views, etc. But in the long term, these users might have a bad perception of the brand and
[05:51] stop using the product, or they might be so annoyed with the product that they entirely disengage.
[05:59] And yes, I'm looking at you, Zillow. I've unsubscribe to your newsletters so many times,
[06:05] and I am still getting emails to the point that I've had to put them on my block list.
[06:10] So that's an example where spamming will lead your user to disengage completely, which is again,
[06:16] not good for the long term. Let's dive into the 8 growth tactics that I want to share with you
[06:22] today. And we're going to separate them into three different categories. The first being
[06:26] increase in conversion, the second being targeting, and the third we're going to talk about content
[06:31] and visuals. So the first bucket around increasing your conversion starts with shortening the funnel.
[06:39] What does that mean? One example I like to show here is the infamous or rather famous TikTok.
[06:46] Most mobile apps will ask you to sign up first before you're able to get any value from the product.
[06:53] And I remember fondly that my first experience of TikTok was not that. Instead,
[06:59] they delivered me the value first, which was they allowed me to see and peruse the content so
[07:04] that I understood what value I was getting before I gave any value to the company, which was
[07:10] signing up with my personal information. And from that, I remember being more enticed to sign up
[07:16] because I was excited to then get more personalized content. So what is this tactic actually?
[07:22] It's basically removing the number of steps it takes for your users to complete the action you
[07:28] want them to take. Because think about it. The more steps you add in there for them to complete
[07:34] that action, the less likely they're going to do the thing that you want them to do. So make the process
[07:40] easier for them. And how would you do that? You'd map out the funnel of the different steps it takes
[07:47] to complete the action you want them to do, whether that's purchasing something, whether that's engaging
[07:52] with the video, you'd identify amongst the steps what is the largest drop-offs? And then ask
[08:00] yourself, do you really need this step? For example, if you were asking users to sign up and let's
[08:06] say one of your steps is asking them for their social security number. Me as a company, I would ask
[08:10] myself, do I really need this information for the users to accomplish a task or for me as a business
[08:16] again in benefit? Probably not. And if for some reason you actually didn't need the social security
[08:21] number, say you're the IRS. And if the answer is yes, it is necessary. The fourth thing you want to do
[08:28] is can you make this step easier perhaps? For example, some people don't have their social security
[08:34] on hand, but maybe there's some service that you can link them to which automatically imports
[08:39] your social security number. So as you can tell, growth is basically a set of experiments,
[08:44] which is all about learning what levers work and what impact they have. If you're curious about
[08:49] experiments and want to see video, comment below with your questions and I'll look to create maybe
[08:55] a future video on experimentation. Tactic number two we'll talk about is setting smart defaults.
[09:01] So an example, have you ever donated to Wikipedia? So I always donate to the Wikipedia
[09:07] foundation when asked because sometimes they'll sign up these campaigns. And I've noticed the
[09:12] asked of for donations. Instead of a fill in the blank, they've given me a preset default choices
[09:19] ranging from $5 to $10 to $20, etc. Another example, have you gone to a restaurant recently
[09:27] where they use a point of sale system and when they swivel around that tablet for you to pay a tip,
[09:32] they give you options of 15%, 20%, 25% for you to choose rather than previously what existed,
[09:40] where one you had to write it on paper, but it was a fill in the blank that you then had to figure out
[09:46] how much to give. So these smart defaults, if you looked at the data, have allowed users to engage
[09:51] more with the product because making a decision is just easier. So what is this tactic?
[09:59] Basically, when users are asked to make a decision, have preset defaults that's a good balance
[10:05] between the user's interest and your business interest. And why emphasize this balance is because
[10:12] a product can have defaults that skew towards a product's interest, which then engages users.
[10:20] So imagine we talked about the tipping and instead of the 15, 20, 25%, a business could show a
[10:26] default of 25%, 40%, and 50%. And because those numbers go out of the usual range that users would
[10:36] tip, users seeing that might then decide to not tip at all. Another example where defaults have
[10:42] really helped me stick to a product is TurboTax. So the first time you use it, they saved my information,
[10:48] and then the next years it just became easier to file my taxes because all of that information
[10:53] was saved. Hence, because of that, I will probably stay a TurboTax customer for a number of years,
[11:00] though I feel like they are definitely taking advantage of that because this year they decided
[11:05] to charge me for certain features that in the previous years were free. How would you use this
[11:09] tactic? Because basically start with mapping out the funnel and understanding where are their
[11:16] key user decision points and where of those decision points are their drop offs. Then secondly,
[11:21] you would go look at the data to understand, well, in these key decision points, what
[11:27] are users usually choosing? If it's currently filling the blank today, what are the most common
[11:33] things that people are choosing to select? Or even not looking at the data, you might ask yourself
[11:38] as a product team, what are defaults that you would select? That's a fair balance between what
[11:42] users want and what our product team wants. And we know from high school test taking days how much
[11:48] easier multiple choice exams were than filling the blank. The third tactic is saving unfinished
[11:54] progress. So have you ever done some online shopping and you've spent 30 minutes and hour shopping,
[12:00] adding a bunch of things into your cart? Then either accidentally or you exit out of the website
[12:06] because you forget that you were on it. Then when you come back, all the things in your cart were
[12:11] gone. So you did all that work and you're much less likely to do that shopping experience again
[12:17] to put things into the cart. Versus companies like Sephora have really understood this and it's
[12:22] that every time I have shopped in Sephora for a while and suddenly forget about the website and exit
[12:28] my whole browser, when I go back to the website, they'll have the things that I put into my cart ready
[12:34] for me. And this is even if I'm not logged in, I believe. So that way when I go back to the
[12:40] Sephora website, I can start on where I left off. Hence, what is this tactic here? If people
[12:47] abandon a part of the flow and they leave the website, make sure to save their progress.
[12:53] The for example, if a customer is signing up for this lengthy form, for example, I worked at a
[12:59] company where we were helping companies incorporate their businesses. That is pretty lengthening and a
[13:04] lot of times people will leave in the middle, but we help them save their progress so that when they
[13:10] came back, they were able to jump back into where they left off, which made it easier and more
[13:15] likely for them to not go to a different service. And you can go even one step further and follow
[13:22] up with the users over email to remind them where they left off and to start. I didn't include this
[13:27] here, but there's a bunch of growth tactics around social validation, what drove a lot of these
[13:32] social companies. And this is a very powerful bucket in itself that I've gotten users to take
[13:37] certain actions. If you want a video on this comment below and let me know what questions you have,
[13:42] the second bucket of growth tactics that I talked about was to do with targeting. So this is
[13:47] targeting the right people at the right place at the right time. So my tactic number four on this
[13:52] list is to use behavioral versus demographic targeting. So an example, the last year I was shopping
[14:01] for a winter jacket and I landed on Dick's boarding good. Chose a size was about to check out,
[14:07] but decided not to because I wanted to keep it in the cart to see if there's anything cheaper.
[14:11] And I noticed after doing that, whether I was on Instagram or some news app, I was seeing that same
[14:21] jacket as an ad. Yes, it's creepy and it almost seemed like this cookie or whatever it was was
[14:26] follow me around, but it's highly effective, you can imagine. I wasn't bothered by it. And I noticed
[14:32] it did lead me to want that jacket even more and to go back to Dick's boarding good again to see
[14:38] if I should bite. So what is this tactic doing? If people take certain user actions, which is then
[14:45] defined as a behavior, then target them. This is as opposed to demographic targeting, which is more
[14:52] oh, if there's a 35 year old mother, target those specific people. And how do you want to do this?
[14:58] First, you want to identify certain user actions that are the most correlated or closest to the
[15:06] tests that you want users to complete. In the example I gave with Dick's boarding good, it might
[15:11] target users who have chosen a size and are about to check out, but it might not target users who
[15:18] are just perusing through different listings. And the second step, it would then find people who
[15:23] are taking those user actions and targeting them with messages or in this case, it was an ad across
[15:30] the internet. That way it would nudge them towards completing certain actions. Of course, here
[15:35] there's a fine balance. We talked about that foundational principle of balance. You don't want to
[15:39] be spammy or super creepy or take too much information from a user. Facting number five is the
[15:45] right placement. So have you ever noticed recently when you've booked a flight on an airline?
[15:52] Right before you check out, they will ask you, do you want travel insurance? Do you want
[15:57] car rentals, hotel bookings? The whole night? Do you want this travel vacation package?
[16:03] Basically, they're selling you all these other services that are related and in context with
[16:09] the thing that you were doing, which is booking a flight. Which totally makes sense because when
[16:13] you're booking a flight, you'll need to do those things anyways. So what is this tactic?
[16:18] It's basically putting the things you want your users to accomplish in context or that's
[16:24] complementary to something else that they're already doing. Facting number six is targeting users
[16:31] at the right time. You have no idea how important this can be. So for example, so I've noticed in
[16:36] the morning, YouTube is more likely to show me meditation yoga videos versus if I log into YouTube
[16:42] at night, you'll show me more music videos. Why? This is because previously, most times when I go
[16:49] onto YouTube, I'm searching for yoga, meditation, breathing videos. So they've learned that at that
[16:56] time of the day, those are the type of videos that I am most engaged with. And hence, this leads me
[17:02] to engage with a product even more. So what is this tactic? It's basically showing users things
[17:08] at times when they are most likely to complete the action you want them to take. So something like
[17:13] this, you might not necessarily know off the top of your head. You can rationalize. So for example,
[17:18] when people are at work, maybe they're not likely to book a flight or maybe they are because we
[17:24] try to find distractions during work. So hence, you might not target them during the weark day
[17:28] to book a flight, but show them that at night. The third bucket of things is to test content.
[17:35] So have you ever noticed those ads at the bottom of certain websites that are pretty clickbaiting?
[17:42] They'll show some photo of sometimes some group tests thing and then have content like,
[17:48] guess what happened to this person after they did X or show some celebrity dramatic thing? Or
[17:56] you've most likely have seen news headlines that seem almost over dramatic. Or more innocently,
[18:03] has there been a time where you've noticed yourself opening up an email that was not relevant to
[18:07] you at all, but because it had your name, you're more likely to open it. So this all comes with a
[18:12] power of content. And here the tactic is, content is hugely important on the action that you're
[18:19] taking. So when you create content that's more urgent or shocking or creates this what we like to
[18:24] call curiosity grabs. And this is actually what we're taught when we're creating our thumbnails,
[18:30] creating a heading that's attention grabbing. Of course, I'm not advising product teams to create
[18:37] things that are clickbaiting, but rather realize the power content has and design it. So it does provide
[18:44] a good ratio between value and informational, but also has some elements of it that lure people in.
[18:51] So what are some ways you can do this? For example, a couple are you can make your call to action
[18:58] more urgent. You can lead with aspirational text rather than telling users what they should do.
[19:05] You can guide people to the next step and handhold them, making it easier for them to accomplish
[19:10] the action you want them to do, personalize emails with names or any type of personalization people
[19:16] love. And lastly, localize the content of their language. So it increases their comprehension of
[19:22] what you're trying to tell them. The last tactic we'll talk about, I would say it might be even
[19:27] more powerful than content is visuals. For example, Airbnb, what learned early on that photos
[19:35] was hugely important in getting its customers to book places. And knowing this insight, it actually
[19:43] sent photographers to people's homes to capture the photos for them because we know us trying to
[19:48] take a photo when we're not professionally doing it might be lackluster. But what is this
[19:54] tactic? Well, we know that visuals capture people's attention and hence leveraging that to show
[20:00] visuals that really resonate with users on what you're trying to get them to accomplish. It doesn't
[20:05] necessarily have to be the most cinematographic, but using visuals that either speak to a pain point
[20:12] or shows a customer aspiration, anything that perhaps resonates with them could be a great way
[20:18] for them to then engage with their product. So in this video, we talked about eight growth tactics
[20:23] that you can use to grow your product to millions of users. Well, how might you add a multiplier
[20:28] effect with this? Well, you'd want to combine it with growth marketing strategies. So here's a video
[20:34] on six effective growth marketing strategies that you can use to continue to grow your product to
[20:40] millions of users. And I will see you guys in the next video.
