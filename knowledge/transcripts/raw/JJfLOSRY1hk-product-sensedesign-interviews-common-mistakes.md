[00:00] So you want to ace your upcoming product sense interviews?
[00:04] If so, you probably want to avoid the most common mistakes and traps that average and weaker
[00:10] candidates fall into.
[00:12] I've helped a ton of clients prepare for product interviews at Top Tech companies, and initially
[00:18] a lot of them when they first came to me did not even realize they were making these mistakes.
[00:23] So in this video, I've compiled an entire list of common mistakes, traps that I see that
[00:29] you can learn to avoid.
[00:31] So by the end of the video, you'll be a bit more aware if you're already making any
[00:36] of these mistakes.
[00:37] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a large tech company in Silicon
[00:44] Valley, California, and I bring you the best tips to get into product management and teach
[00:50] you how to succeed once you've made it.
[00:52] So a lot of the times when candidates do the things that I'm going to be talking about,
[00:56] they come off one.
[00:58] Not sounding as if they're actually thinking during the interview, but rather reading off
[01:03] of the script.
[01:04] Two, they end up asking too many questions that make me think that they're not doing enough
[01:09] to drive the conversation.
[01:12] Three, they end up requiring too much prompting and nudging so that I'm basically handholding
[01:18] them during the interview.
[01:20] And number four, they end up making decisions that seem really subjective versus objective
[01:26] and data driven.
[01:28] So what I want to cover in today's video, first, I'm going to start off reviewing the product
[01:33] sense framework for those who need a refresher because we're going to use the sections in
[01:38] the product sense framework to break down the common mistakes that I see in each section.
[01:44] Then secondly, I'm going to talk about the most common mistakes that I see.
[01:49] I'm going to give you a sense of what they sound like when interviews say those things.
[01:54] And then we're going to talk about how to improve it and actually make it better.
[01:59] So let's start off by reviewing the product sense framework.
[02:02] The product sense question is meant to test whether you can take an ambiguous space and
[02:09] turn it into products that people could love because it solves their problems.
[02:14] Hence to answer this question, comprises of four sections.
[02:18] So the motivation is basically why should we build this?
[02:27] User segmentation is who should we build this for?
[02:30] Identifying pain points means for our target users, what are the things that they're struggling
[02:37] with that we can help solve?
[02:39] And number four is coming up with clever solutions.
[02:42] If you want to see some best practices for the product sense question, take a look at
[02:48] this video that I've shared before to get my best tips on how to ace the product sense
[02:54] interview.
[02:55] But for now, let's dive into the most common mistakes that I see.
[03:00] So the first section, which I actually didn't even mention in the framework, is before candidates
[03:05] go into starting their framework, they actually spend some time upfront asking clarifying
[03:10] questions.
[03:11] To a common mistake that I see when people ask clarifying questions is sometimes they ask
[03:17] clarifying questions that don't really matter.
[03:20] And other times they ask clarifying questions that they should really figure out and not
[03:24] me giving them the answer.
[03:26] So for example, some questions that don't really matter during the product sense interview
[03:30] is should this be a mobile or desktop?
[03:33] Is there a time constraint with building this?
[03:36] Most times the company isn't trying to test whether you can build a product under a very
[03:41] tight specific constraint.
[03:43] Other questions that you should be figuring out that a lot of people ask is which market
[03:48] should we build this for?
[03:49] What's the business objective?
[03:52] And the last one is should we be building this for a company X?
[03:56] So what I recommend in the clarifying question section is altogether avoid questions that
[04:03] again are not going to impact your answer if you get the answer.
[04:06] For example, if I told you was mobile, how would that change your answer?
[04:10] It wouldn't really.
[04:11] And you also don't have to front load all your clarifying questions.
[04:16] Feel free to ask them throughout the interview.
[04:19] Some questions that are okay to ask are I know X companies are already building a similar
[04:24] product like the one you're asking me to build.
[04:27] Should I consider that?
[04:29] Or should we consider building this product pre-COVID or during I'm post-COVID?
[04:36] The next thing that I see a lot of people forget to do in the beginning of the interview
[04:41] is actually share their structure.
[04:44] It's really important to share your structure so your interviewer knows where you're going
[04:48] to be going and if you're missing any critical things they can early on insert it or if you
[04:54] over-scoped and added too many things they can say no let's leave that out of the focus.
[05:00] And to that point of over-scoping some candidates end up adding a metric section at the end of
[05:06] a product sense question and know that's usually not in scope because they test that in
[05:10] an entirely different interview.
[05:12] So they don't try to squeeze in a whole other section and not do well on the most important
[05:17] sections that they're testing.
[05:19] Now we're going to break down for each of the four sections of the product sense framework
[05:23] what are common mistakes that we see.
[05:26] So we're going to start off with motivation.
[05:28] So that section again is answering why should we build this for this particular company?
[05:33] For the motivation section the most common mistake that I see is people assume that the
[05:39] question that they're asking about or the product they're asking them to build should
[05:44] be built for the company that they're interviewing for.
[05:47] So what does this sound like?
[05:49] An interview we might ask I just want to clarify are we building this for Google and the
[05:54] interviewer says you decide and the interview we replies okay I'm just going to assume that
[06:01] we're Google building this product that you're asking me about.
[06:05] Take this opportunity to actually strategically assess whether the company that you're interviewing
[06:10] for should be building about the space they're asking you about.
[06:14] And I want to be asking myself is it aligned to our mission or are there strengths that
[06:18] we have to win in this space and three how is it going to help us grow.
[06:23] So something I commonly hear when I give the question build the product to improve the
[06:29] grocery store experience and people interviewing for say Facebook would come back saying well
[06:34] Facebook's mission is to connect people and build community in this case we're connecting
[06:40] grocery stores and people shopping at grocery stores.
[06:43] So hence I think it's aligned with Facebook's mission.
[06:46] I don't know if you can tell but that was a really generic response because I literally
[06:50] could have given the candidate any space and they would have just said yes it's aligned
[06:56] with the mission because I'm connecting the demand side and supply side.
[07:00] A better way to tackle this is if the interview we said something like okay let me figure out
[07:07] why we should build this and I want to consider a couple things first is this aligned to the
[07:12] mission of the company.
[07:14] Second what are strengths that we as a company have to win in this space.
[07:19] Third what is the market opportunity and size that gets us excited about investing in
[07:25] this space and fourth do we have any competitive advantages that are going to help us win over
[07:32] any other competitor.
[07:34] This is probably one of the most important parts of the question because think about it think
[07:39] of this as an investment pitch and the investment pitch first starts off with why do we care
[07:45] about building in this space and if you come up with something generic and weak the investors
[07:50] not going to let you go on with the rest of the presentation so be thoughtful in this
[07:54] section and don't just come off with a generic response.
[07:57] Now the second part of the product sense framework is user segmentation.
[08:03] It comes with a mistake that I see people make in a user segmentation is either not being
[08:07] brought enough or being too granular.
[08:11] So for example say I gave the candidate the question we want to build something in the
[08:15] travel space and a candidate responds when I think about travelers I think about business
[08:21] travelers people who need to bring pets when they're traveling and leisure travelers a
[08:28] better way to approach it is to go from broader buckets to them more granular buckets but
[08:33] not too granular.
[08:35] So for example if I was to respond to that prompt again I would say if I think about travel
[08:40] it's a multi-sided ecosystem where we have the travelers on one side and the businesses
[08:45] providing the services to travelers on another side and say I wanted to focus on travelers
[08:51] if I break that down even further I want to break it down into leisure travelers and business
[08:57] travelers who have totally different needs.
[09:00] A second mistake that I see people doing all the time when they're segmenting users is
[09:05] that when they prioritize one of the segments they don't give you an objective criteria
[09:10] or reason why they're choosing that segment.
[09:14] So this sounds something like well I would choose business travelers because they have
[09:18] the most needs.
[09:20] The most needs is quite subjective.
[09:22] Me as an interviewer I might think leisure travelers have the most need.
[09:27] So what would help is a more objective criteria either explaining how you quantified most needs
[09:33] so that we're able to compare leisure travelers needs versus business travelers or find more
[09:38] objective criteria.
[09:40] For example a better way to evaluate which segment to choose is looking at what is the
[09:46] size of these populations to compare to each other.
[09:50] What is the frequency of how they use say travel products and a third criteria what is their
[09:56] willingness to spend if we're going to develop a product and we want to monetize off a
[10:00] bit we'd rather choose a group that has a high propensity to spend so we can actually make
[10:05] revenue.
[10:06] The third common mistake I see people make during segmenting users is not being me see.
[10:12] So what does me see stand for mutually exclusive comprehensively exhaustive which means your
[10:18] segmentations again should be mutually exclusive so that they're not intersecting amongst
[10:23] each other and also comprehensively exhaustive so you're trying to cover as much of the
[10:29] population that would use this product as possible.
[10:32] So what this sounds like to again the same prompt of build something in the travel space
[10:37] is for travelers there's people who travel in groups people who are mothers that travel
[10:43] people who travel with kids travelers who are college students so do you see how some
[10:48] of those groups might intersect for example people who travel in groups and people who travel
[10:54] with kids while those groups might be families and they might be traveling with kids so that
[10:59] does not meet the mutually exclusive part of it.
[11:02] A better way to segment it so it's mutually exclusive but also comprehensively exhaustive
[11:08] is when we think about travelers we have people who travel in groups people who are solo
[11:14] travelers and people who are couples I mean think about it if you're solo traveler you
[11:19] can't be a traveler that travels in groups I mean maybe sometimes if you guys are finding
[11:23] this video helpful so far I'd love for you to like the video and subscribe to the channel
[11:29] because we're going to be producing even more content to help you ace your product interview.
[11:35] Now let's move on to the third part of the product sense framework and what common mistakes
[11:40] we see people make there.
[11:41] The first one is most people tend to come up with needs rather than pain points so what
[11:47] does that sound like?
[11:48] Well if I'm thinking about travelers some of the things that they struggle with are deciding
[11:55] what place to go to, organizing the trip, coordinating with the group and then deciding what
[12:01] to do when they arrive at the place.
[12:03] Sure these are general struggles but they're not specific and deep enough to show user
[12:09] empathy.
[12:10] You really want to use those general needs and think about what sucks in each of these
[12:16] parts and each of these needs so what's a better way to tackle this?
[12:20] Well if I wasn't thinking about the user journey for travelers the first is deciding where
[12:25] to go.
[12:27] That's a need but some of the pain points they have is not having enough information between
[12:33] all the places they could go in terms of budget that they would need and on top of that a
[12:38] lot of the information is fragmented and it's hard to do that comparison.
[12:43] So in this section what could really help you go the second level of death in empathy is
[12:48] asking yourself when was the last time you had to deal with this situation and what sucked
[12:53] about it and the second mistake that I see people do while identifying pain points is not
[13:00] using an objective criteria to choose and decide which pain point to go with.
[13:05] So this sounds like okay I'm going to go with the pain point of deciding where to go because
[13:09] it's the first step in the journey and hence if I don't solve this the other steps won't
[13:15] even happen.
[13:16] A better way to value which pain point you should choose is to actually come up with a strong
[13:22] criteria.
[13:23] So say I want to optimize on which of these pain point affect the largest part of the
[13:28] population and which of these pain points don't have any existing solutions.
[13:33] So you see how that's much more about an objective criteria or add the last section of
[13:39] the product sense framework which is solutions.
[13:42] So what kind of a mistake do we see in the solution section?
[13:45] The first one I see with people trying to come with creative solutions is that they use
[13:49] certain technologies and trends but very shallowly this sounds like for travel I would fill
[13:56] something that enlists VR and AR to help people decide where to go.
[14:01] That just sounds like you're choosing your pain point and having a technology and smushing
[14:06] it together without giving any detail of how the experience is going to be unique or innovative.
[14:12] So a better way would sound something like my solution is going to be using a VR and
[14:18] AR experience where we can basically put the user who needs to decide where to go in multiple
[14:25] places at the same time so they can actually get a feeling of what it's like to be in the
[14:30] pyramids of Giza versus in the rainforests in Brazil.
[14:35] So you see how that example basically leverages the strengths of VR AR and defines what the
[14:41] experience would actually be like for the user so that the interviewer actually gets
[14:45] excited about the solution.
[14:48] And the last common mistake I see people make during the solution section is talking about
[14:52] solutions that already exist.
[14:54] So for example for the prompt, build a product to help people find doctors.
[14:59] A bad response or one that's ignorant of the existing solution sounds like well I would
[15:05] build a product that allows people to search across a directory of doctors and read reviews
[15:11] and filter on their insurance.
[15:13] Well this already exists so good job in identifying a needed market but it's already been solved.
[15:20] So how are you going to add something innovative on top of that?
[15:23] So a better way is actually first acknowledge that there's an existing solution and what
[15:28] you would build on top to make it even better.
[15:31] So this sounds like for finding a doctor there already existed a website out there where
[15:36] you can search a director of doctors, filter and read reviews.
[15:41] But what's missing that really helps people decide doctors is what issues that doctors
[15:47] have dealt with before.
[15:48] So I build something that kind of captures the doctor's experience with dealing with specific
[15:53] issues, say type 2 diabetes and add that to a list to allow people to easily find doctors
[16:00] that specialize in the issues that they're dealing with.
[16:03] By the way as I'm going through these are you seeing yourself make any of these common
[16:07] mistakes?
[16:08] If so I'd love for you to come and below which mistake you're making so that you can
[16:12] be it come aware to avoid these in the future.
[16:15] And you want to avoid these mistakes because they reflect average or weaker candidates who
[16:20] are not thinking during the interview who are asking too many questions and not driving
[16:25] the interview enough who need prompting and hand holding which again doesn't show a
[16:30] leader trying to hire product leaders and for end up showing something who can't use
[16:35] data to make decisions.
[16:38] So avoid these mistakes at all cost and now you know the mistakes to avoid you'll still
[16:43] want to figure out what are the best things that I can do to ace the interview.
[16:47] So take a look at these two videos focused on product sense and the best practices that
[16:53] I've developed through working with tons of candidates interviewing for top tech companies.
[16:58] I'll see you later guys.
