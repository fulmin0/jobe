## Transcript

[00:00] Great. So the question we have for you today, Trish, is let's say you are a PM at meta and thinking about investing in the fitness space.
[00:09] Okay. What product would you build to help people become more fit?
[00:13] So hey, everyone. I'm Diana. And as you know, this is the channel to help you guys as aspiring product managers get the job of your dreams.
[00:22] And luckily today we have Trish on board.
[00:25] Hi guys, I'm Trish. I'm so excited to be here. Watch Diana's channel a bunch when I was preparing for interviews. I am currently having an offer at meta and I'm going to be joining them very soon.
[00:36] Previously, I was a senior product manager at GrubHub.
[00:39] Great. So the question we have for you today, Trish, is let's say you are a PM at meta and we're thinking about investing in the fitness space.
[00:48] Okay. What product would you build to help people become more fit?
[00:52] As a meta PM, when we say we're investing in the fitness space, is it up for me to decide whether this is something that's going to be on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or a standalone product or is there any direction you'd like me to go.
[01:05] Let's say we're going to incorporate this into the blue app.
[01:08] But the way I want to handle this is first I kind of want to talk about the mission of meta and the why, right.
[01:13] Why would we as meta be interested in investing in this space and what would be why would we build a product for this.
[01:19] Next, I want to go on talk about, you know, the various user segments associated with this and prioritize who we'd want to focus on and what we should be building for.
[01:28] Next, I want to talk about some pain points and just like an overall user journey.
[01:32] I think by doing this will kind of be able to identify, you know, what are those people problems that we can be focusing on in space to create a differentiated product.
[01:41] And then lastly come up with a couple of solutions and prioritize.
[01:44] Does all that sound good to you?
[01:46] That sounds perfect. I don't be of extra time at the end. I might ask involved questions.
[01:50] Great. Okay. I'm going to take like 20 seconds here to kind of brainstorm a bit on the mission and then I'll share my thoughts with you.
[01:56] I think you're time.
[01:58] And thinking about whether we want to build this product right I really want to think about what the mission of the meta is and how this really grow love to our mission.
[02:05] So the mission of meta is to empower people to build communities and bring the world closer together.
[02:10] When I think about fitness, right, I think what comes to mind now is it's kind of huge emphasis that fitness has really changed over the years and become a much more of a community and communal aspect everything from.
[02:21] And then I think that it's really important to be able to find a community where people are constantly high five in each other and interacting to, you know, Instagram influencers being able to share their workouts and have live communities, which is our, you know, platform.
[02:33] It's really clear that community and fitness kind of go hand in hand and this has become something that has really changed like the game and fitness like.
[02:40] And people so good of a gym and maybe like do a solo work on and come home, I think that that's kind of more than minority now and fitness is not become this group, you know, group fitness communal thing with social media people sharing what they like to do.
[02:53] So for me, I think it's completely makes sense why meta we want to invest in this.
[02:57] Thinking about some trend in the space, right, I think with COVID we saw a huge change in how people handled fitness at home fitness became really popular. Why because gym is we're close.
[03:07] And here you see the rise of things like peloton and apps and kind of ways for you to get your workouts in at home instead of, you know, going to gyms.
[03:16] One other thing is important to kind of talk about here is the fact that people leverage our products and platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, especially comes to mind to start following influencers and maybe doing their live workouts with them and things like that.
[03:29] And that was really a good way for us to kind of start training in the space, even though we didn't have a specific product for it.
[03:37] Thinking about competition, I think there's a few, you know, really big players that come to mind have already referenced peloton peloton has really become the golden standard for fitness apps, especially for at home fitness.
[03:49] I know myself has I have the bike and I think a lot of people, you know, really love this app because of the fact that you can literally do everything from biking to runs to strength fitness and you can either have the equipment or not right appell time membership, you don't have to have a bike.
[04:05] So this became really popular and something that I think really changed the game and fitness also the fact that you know there are other apps coming for fitness like Strava the Equinox app and things like that and the last thing that comes to mind is Apple watches.
[04:17] I think that that really changed the game and fitness right I have one right now everybody want to close their ring and there is kind of the social aspect where people are kind of sharing their workouts with other people and things right so that's definitely something we need to consider here.
[04:31] And then lastly kind of test it on some like strengths and risks so a strength of meta right we have a huge existing user base right the fact that we have this chances are out of the billions of people that are using our applications a lot of people are interested in fitness or some people even you know use that as their day to day or their job and other people are trying to get into it so.
[04:50] So there definitely will be some interest around this also the fact that you know we have your and really great technology and I think that you can see that there are now trends with the aren't fitness merge.
[05:00] The last thing i'll say before moving on to users just thinking about the fact that like there is one risk here that I really want to bring to our attention is the fact that this is a pretty saturated market right I feel like talking to the trends competition and everything we went through it's very clear that this is like technically a new space with the fact that there are a lot of the spoke at the end of the day.
[05:19] There are a lot of the spoke apps that are like created specifically for this so we're going to want to create something differentiated here that is something that we have to our advantage that maybe be competitors to that.
[05:30] So i just want to pause here I know that was a lot do you have any questions on that is all of them makes fun.
[05:35] In terms of how do you think investing this space for meta is going to benefit it as a company or as a business.
[05:42] Yeah that is a great question I would say a few things so I think first a big benefit I see is kind of a way to re engage existing users right I think that there's Facebook there's Instagram there's WhatsApp and of course like these are all amazing platforms that we already have but having somebody having a app or some are part of blue that's like the spoke to fitness is a really great way for meta to re engage existing users that may have kind of lost engagement with the app right.
[06:09] Second thing monetization fitness is definitely a very lucrative industry and so while in a V1 I wouldn't necessarily focus on monetization maybe later on right there's some partnerships or some advertisement things down the road that could really benefit us in the long run as well.
[06:25] Okay that's super clear awesome anything else before we move on to user segment.
[06:31] Just for the crowd who is your favorite person on teleton and we talked about this.
[06:36] Oh it's a great question so Kendall tool by far my favorite instructor she is definitely makes you work hard but also a lot of fun pop songs that I love nice check her out so before it's going to be user segments I think one thing that I want to clarify is that you know when we talk about fitness right that can mean a lot of different things that can mean you know help coaching that can mean like exercise fitness that can mean nutrition.
[07:00] I think to me though like when you think about like this rise in technology intersecting with fitness and where that really becomes up something that meta could participate in to me it's really thinking about like that exercising part of fitness because they can that's something that is accessible to all and clearly a space where you know technology.
[07:18] Intersects heavily does that make sense like before kind of moving on I just wanted to clarify that with you so that makes sense.
[07:26] Alright cool so what the game I use your segments I think here's kind of like really like high level book it's and then we'll kind of zero in so to me right I see these high level bucket as kind of creators and fitness right so you're like influencers or like personal trainers or people that are already using social media are things like that to kind of help people kind of start their journey or stay accountable and things like that.
[07:50] Then there's kind of like third parties and by third parties I mean things like gym studios and classes and other things right and this may be affiliated with the creators or not but it's kind of just like part of the ecosystem and then lastly there's kind of this end user bucket and I see end users as kind of people who are either interested in fitness or are already on a fitness journey on their own and that's kind of the end user of the product and who I think it really makes sense to focus on and fills for.
[08:18] Between that though I think that like that is kind of a big bucket of people so we want to further break that down into like a smaller like smaller bucket and then prioritize hmm so I would see you know people interested in fitness or on a fitness journey I think there's really like three different types of like user here so the first thing I think somebody with like a really low motivation or as like not interested in fitness at all right and I think this type of person is like maybe they don't really care about it or they don't want to or like they don't really know where to start or where.
[08:48] But it's essentially somebody that is not you know very far along on their journey at the very like lower end of that.
[08:54] Next I think there's kind of this bucket of somebody that's like medium motivation or somebody that is you know maybe doing a couple workouts a week but isn't really like in a routine and like seeking to a plan so I would consider the most steps above the people who are not interested in fitness at all but maybe not you know expert and then the third bucket I could think of is kind of like experts or somebody with a highly motivated.
[09:17] Fitness user and this somebody that's really used to their fitness routine or regime you know somebody that maybe is like oh I worked out on these days a week and I do this and I do that they have a plan they stick to it so I think like it kind of makes sense to bucket this way because the needs of each of these groups are like fundamentally different so when thinking about prioritizing these I think there's a few different criteria that I want to like think about when we're doing that so I think first I'm just going to draw a quick matrix here so I think first right I'd want to look at like the region.
[09:47] Like what is the size of this market.
[09:49] Secondly I'd want to think about like an impact and when I think when I say impact that kind of mean like how impactful can that be based on our position and our products and you know our mission in this group and then lastly is this an underserved audience because if it is chances are we can probably you know tap into the audience and create a really differentiated product.
[10:11] Is that my sense yeah okay so if you could see on the whiteboard I drew kind of a quick matrix low medium expert and I basically you know gave each a relative score from one to five to decide what bucket so to me it looks like the medium motivation bucket so these of people who aren't really in a routine but do have some motivation towards fitness are the right groups to focus on the reason why is because if you think about like the how impactful with the B as meta right to me like this is the bucket.
[10:41] We could be the most impactful in if somebody is a low motivated person like chances are I mean maybe there are some that we could like bring into you know be become more motivated but there are so many products out there that are already geared towards people who are just starting out so if you're somebody with low motivation there's already a ton of saturated products out there that are like going to you know try to pull you in and create a plan for you.
[11:04] If you're an expert you're probably already in your groove in your routine and you are you know doing whatever you're doing and it's working for you so chances are like you we're not going to be able to be super impactful in this group either however the medium motivation really plays some at a strength wide because of the fact that maybe it's support they need or something like that and as a result right this is something that we could be really impactful in similarly as you know as to that reasoning I think that that's probably the most underserved audience as well and in terms of the most
[11:34] reach to me I think like low and medium probably have a pretty high size of market where expert is probably a much smaller segment of the population so I think to me all this is kind of pointing to the fact that we should prioritize this medium motivation bucket okay so I think I'll take like another couple of seconds here to talk about some pain points or brainstorm them and then I'll share my thoughts with you that's good for sounds.
[11:57] Okay so there's kind of a couple of things that come to mind here in terms of like what would have paid points of this specific user group B so the first thing I could really think of is like lack of time right so I think that if you're somebody that maybe is like working really hard or like has a like busy job which I'm sure like Diana you probably really to or something you don't really have the time to pursue your fitness journey and I know that even if you are motivated right but you don't really have a routine or have it scheduled in like this is something that is probably
[12:27] inhibiting you and I see this as a pretty painful pain point because of the fact that you know if you're really unmotivated to do something but you just physically don't have the time to do it right that unfortunately is something that is really going to bring you down.
[12:40] Second pain point I could think of is kind of like a lack of accountability and support so I can relate to this personally like I know there are so many times where I was like oh I'm going to do this I'm going to do five peltron classes a week and then I'm going to you know change my diet and all this stuff right and the thing is like I have nobody holding you to that and I live on my own
[12:57] so when I don't do it right there's no accountability and support and I just love that it's my own routine old routine so I think I see that as another pain point.
[13:06] The third thing I could think of is kind of this pain point around education and not being sure what to do I think that this is something where you know I had a friend come to me and basically be like oh like you know I want to start lifting but I don't know anything what to do Google there's too much information out there I'm really stressed out about it and so I think this like not being sure what to do or like lack of education is kind of another pain point for people.
[13:27] With the medium motivation bucket they're not the experts and they don't know like oh you should be doing this money cardio and this money strength or you know whatever it may be and as a result you kind of bogs you down and it becomes this really meaningful experience.
[13:40] Fourth pain point I could think of I have five total of like four pain point I could think of is that it's kind of a lonely process and I do think there are some things that existing out there that maybe have tried to like you know solve this but I think all in all if you were somebody that's like trying to work towards these goals and you know you're trying to
[13:57] set up a schedule for yourself if you if you're doing this on your own it's kind of a lonely process and it's quite hard to go through it without having support right so I think this kind of goes again to lack of accountability but kind of more speaking to the emotional pain point that it's a lonely experience.
[14:14] And the last thing I could think of is kind of like aiming too high or having something being hard to stick to so I feel like you know for me right it's like I tried to basically be like oh I'm going to just like change my entire fitness routine
[14:27] and I'm just going to you know run every day and like obviously that was aiming too high and that was really hard to stick to so I think kind of just like this pain point around you know understanding your body and it's needs and making sure you're not setting some crazy goals that you're not going to stick to.
[14:42] Hmm and here is a pain point setting too higher or more general like I don't know what goals is set like how many push-ups can I do really.
[14:51] Right how my understand my understanding myself.
[14:54] Exactly I think it's like I think that's really well said it's kind of just like you know pain point around like a lack of understanding on how to set goals for yourself.
[15:04] Hmm.
[15:05] Cool now the sense that's all they're all really resonate.
[15:09] Right I feel like a lot of people watching this are going to be like yep.
[15:15] And so I'm curious which of these do you feel are specifically targeted towards like this medium group
[15:23] for some of these I can I hear them resonate with the other extremes as well like the time thing all of them.
[15:30] Yes we'll have that challenge.
[15:31] Yeah I'm really glad like you said that like I think that's definitely something that like some of these could definitely be for you know each of the buckets.
[15:38] For me the ones that really jump out of me that are really in this medium motivation group I think the first thing is education not being sure what to do
[15:45] because I think somebody in the low bucket is probably not caring about this and somebody in the expert bucket is probably like
[15:51] they don't need this help right so something around like oh I'm not sure what to do or you know I need education around this to me that's a really big.
[16:00] The second thing is kind of this lack of accountability and support again if somebody is like in an expert bucket they probably have a network of people right that are already doing fitness with them
[16:09] like for the fact that you know they don't need this accountability support because they're already in which it's being.
[16:14] Yeah that's the second one to me that really you know sticks out and then the last one is probably the kind of lack of understanding on how to set goals.
[16:21] For yourself that goes hand in hand with the education. I think loneliness and lack of time probably could be more true for all the bucket and I think you know when we talk about prioritizing here I think I'm going to just think about the three that we just highlighted for the medium bucket because we are focusing on that you do segment and maybe in a V2 we could think about something to solve for lack of time or a lonely process but we really want to be focusing on that bucket.
[16:45] Is that fair? Yep. Yeah that's fair. And the way that I want to so I'm going to create a matrix for this the way I want to do this prioritization I think the first thing I want to focus on is reach so how wide spread is this pain point.
[16:57] And then how painful is this pain point? Stepping criteria and then last criteria is there an existing solution out there that solves for this because if there is it's probably not the best thing for us to do.
[17:08] Okay so looking at these pain points and how we did the matrix I think in terms of just like reach and how painful the pain points are they kind of scored similarly right because they're very hand in hand right lack of accountability.
[17:21] Lack of education and not knowing what to do and lack of a understanding on how to set goals.
[17:25] I think if you're struggling with one of these pain points chances are you're probably struggling with all of them.
[17:30] And so as a result like I kind of think like the reach and like the painful score of them is going to be very very similar.
[17:37] I think the criteria to really focus on here is existing solution right as you can see on the matrix like they scored very differently.
[17:45] So for lack of accountability I give it from a one to five right so five being that there is no existing solution one being that there is.
[17:53] So for lack of accountability there's a three and the reason for this is because you know there's kind of this notion of like personal trainers and help coaches and things and these are people who are meant to hold you accountable so they're absolutely are existing solutions out there for this.
[18:07] For education and not knowing what to do I think there was a very clear existing solution out there called Google right if you're starting out your fitness.
[18:14] You could write or YouTube or Instagram or TikTok if you're just starting out your journey and you don't know what to do there are so many resources out there.
[18:22] So I don't really think that this is a pain point makes sense to focus on the last one however kind of this lack of understanding around how to set goals and stay accountable on them.
[18:31] There's not really a good existing solution out there for this as somebody who uses a bunch of fitness apps and things like that like I use peloton and I use them you know I use equinoxes up.
[18:40] There isn't really a good way to say like okay this is my goal and here's a plan that's going to get get me there and there isn't really a good way to do that.
[18:47] Cool. Okay so I have three kind of ideas that I want to share with you and then you can kind of talk through which ones would make sense to prioritize and what something that kind of jumped out at me as an idea is kind of creating these like fitness communities like via Facebook so think of groups but something a little bit more you know has no little bit more features to it.
[19:08] And I think about this is kind of like you know as a user of somebody who was a media motivation person you would join like a fitness community and these communities would be kind of led by.
[19:17] Creators or trainers or you know people that kind of go on to Facebook or Instagram as these type of influencers and we probably want to do a little verification around just making sure this person is like legitimate and community.
[19:30] And I think you know as you joined this you would basically have some categories to choose from like weight loss or building muscle or hard health or whatever and you would kind of work with this creator or trainer to
[19:41] set your goals like in a physical way like on the community and then kind of write them and calibrate them to other people's goals in the community.
[19:48] And so I think this could be really fun and supportive because you would kind of see you know what your goals are what other people's goals are and you could see kind of a tracker i'm like you know how you're doing to achieve them and this creator or trainer would kind of help you like create a plan.
[20:02] And outside of the actual like goal setting and calibration I kind of see this community aspect of it where there's a chat you could post videos if you do an exercise is you could ask.
[20:10] And receive help for questions you may have kind of really like creating this community aspect around it and not just being strictly like all business.
[20:19] So second one is more around just like a really lean approach so kind of thinking about like a tender style matching so basically what this would do is you would be able to kind of like swipe on you know trainers who can help you set your goals and they could also do the same thing like swipe on you or users that are you know looking for help or like fitness or accountability or goal setting.
[20:39] And it would connect to chat you'll be able to chat with them for support and help and your goals, but definitely like a really lean like type of approach and something that's if you strictly just want.
[20:49] You know somebody to connect with to help you understand set your goals, this would be kind of the way to go.
[20:54] And here also with the setting goals.
[20:57] Yeah, that when we find the trainer, how did they help you set goals is it like they get your weight and exactly so basically like the way that you know a trainer would set goals in like a gym where it's like understanding what you're trying to do and here's your weight and.
[21:12] You know how here's how long you have to do it they would kind of help you create a measurable like goals and plan that you could like stick to and do it also have this line of communication open to communicate on how you're progressing and to hold you accountable on that.
[21:24] Got it. Okay.
[21:26] And then the third one I could think of is kind of thinking about like topping into kind of like AI and kind of like algorithms and like the software that we have is matter of right we have all that information about people there's always like.
[21:38] You know post and videos and things about people who are successful in their journeys and what they did.
[21:43] So I think what you would kind of do is you would come to the app and you would fill out you know it would be on principle maybe a tab or something you'd fill out like.
[21:51] Why you want to start your you know finish journey and what you're trying to do so it's like lose weight or whatever and basically what's other than would do is go through the archives of.
[21:59] Post and people who are like similar to you to basically come out with a plan and goals for you so obviously this is a much harder you know effort approach than the others but it's kind of.
[22:10] Thinking about like a smart way for the website or for meta to kind of take all this information that's already on the platform to create a bespoke plan for you.
[22:20] So you know somebody that was a very similar way to hide as you like posted about their transformation in a year and like this is what they did and like taking all of that type of information.
[22:30] Pulling it together and then kind of coming up with a recommendation for you.
[22:33] Cool.
[22:34] So which would we choose to build that is a great question.
[22:39] So when prioritizing solutions I like to think of a couple of things.
[22:42] So I think I'd like to think about first kind of like you know novelty like is this something that is like a new solution
[22:49] and something that would be really you know impactful second thing I'd want to think about is impact right so basically.
[22:56] It's like what is the impact of each of these and like by impact I mean would it reach more people or you know is what's the like what's the reach of who would use the solution and you know what kind of impacts would it drive.
[23:06] And then third thing is like effort right because if something super high effort below impact it wouldn't really make sense to prioritize it.
[23:13] So looking at all of these and based on those criteria I think I want to go with the first one which is kind of that community aspect to fit this.
[23:20] I don't really think there's like a really good organized way right now via social or anything like that or any of these apps really to be able to kind of.
[23:28] Goals that with somebody that is you know somebody that is trained in this and is really like well versed in it like there's not really an opportunity to do that and then also have this social aspect of kind of accountability right so I think that that's kind of a differentiator and novel.
[23:44] Impact solution and it's definitely like a medium effort but I would see up being able to reuse other components from groups here like video on actual Facebook platforms to build this and as a result maybe it wouldn't be as much effort as you know the third solution which is the crowdsourcing algorithm.
[24:01] So I think that the second solution right the tender style matching thing I think that that's just like a really low.
[24:07] Impact and not really novel at all I'm sure this probably already.
[24:10] I just don't know about it so I think for that reason but I would see one in three of having a really good impact but one being less effort I would want to be on the edge of doing the fitness communities.
[24:22] Everyone that was it for the what product would you build for the fitness space so how did that feel Trish I'd love your home man I'm exhausted.
[24:30] You came off really strong and the motivation section just calling out trends and I really liked how connected to the mission of the company we're building for right it's not always necessarily met up but here the community aspect is important towards then I was recommend folks to close it out with answering how is this going to benefit a business because ultimately yes we are solving people problems but the end of the day of business needs to benefit from it somehow.
[25:00] So that was the first part in the why the user segmentation a trend that I saw throughout that was really solid that Trish did is the prioritization it was always very clear where criteria was upfront as she was making her decision.
[25:14] And she showed you through the matrix that she drew out so if I had any questions.
[25:19] Beyond what she explained I can sort of dive in and ask oh like why was that low we had the low motivated medium and high.
[25:28] And here I might go with something that is kind of similar just thinking about people less so about motivation but where they're at right now so beginner intermediate and like advance and kind of characterize them like advance or the people that are the Arnold shorts and acres in the gym we know them when we see them you know what I mean.
[25:50] But that industry from coming up with good solid pain points like everything you said really resonated.
[25:56] I think what was especially strong was that you went deep in explaining them because someone could have just said like oh people are not accountable or people don't know how to set goals I could have this right up there.
[26:09] But the depth you went in explaining like why that's painful.
[26:14] In terms of accountability I mean because you're not held accountable you lose track and you kind of give up.
[26:22] And we all know we've been there even if it's not with fitness so that's something I recommend go deep in your pain points and you drew from your personal examples that was really helpful as well.
[26:34] And then last but not least solutions.
[26:37] I would have loved to hear more about the like goal setting portion we identify that as a pain point.
[26:44] And I wanted more technically like how are we going to figure out what works well for again 128 530.
[26:51] Got it.
[26:52] Last one most specifically address that versus some of the top where I was trying to I guess I was asking like oh is the trainer just going to set it for you based on like there.
[27:04] Or maybe the community I don't know like proposed it proposes it for you because that is the hard part right like for someone that's some weight for some amount of time how do we get that down to a week by week goal or something like that.
[27:19] Make some oh and I was going to call out the first thing that really shown through about Trish was her energy.
[27:28] Excited to tackle this problem you saw that for that since you got the offer and many people are looking up to you now.
[27:36] Oh man.
[27:37] What are maybe two to three tips that you would offer to the community.
[27:41] Oh yeah for sure.
[27:43] Okay so I think first tip I would say is like there's no such thing as too much practice like I but it's like I think it's like quality of practice of a quantity.
[27:53] So I think you know for me I was hearing oh you have to keep doing all this mock interviews and mock interviews and that's definitely true you should but some of my most valuable practice was just like looking at questions and just doing it on my own and
[28:06] to be too loud and recording myself like I think just you know yeah I did that help.
[28:11] Yeah it was really helpful because I wanted to see like how if I was kind of like I have the tendency which I'm sure people in this video might have seen to kind of go off on tangents.
[28:21] And so I wanted to record and hear myself and make sure I was being really concise into the point.
[28:25] So like if you don't know you know you have two or three areas you want to work on you know record yourself doing it and watch for it.
[28:31] It helped me improve so much and you know by the time I got the offer I was doing the interview at the I was
[28:36] done like I was so impressed by how concise I was so that's definitely huge tip for me.
[28:41] Yeah that's a new one for me I love it.
[28:43] Um and then I think the second thing is kind of like don't get overwhelmed or discouraged like when I first started at the process I was like there's so much content out there.
[28:51] There's so many books about like who's the best way to prepare and develop love which like by the way plug for Diana like all of her videos and her coaching I could not have done this without her.
[29:00] So definitely if you're trying to figure out what the best content is like you know little shameless plug here but I think like just it's really easy to overbeat over one will be like oh my god there's so much out there I'm never going to learn this just take a deep breath take a step back and take it one at a time right I was like you know these this week I'm going to focus on fence next week I'm going to focus on execution and then you know next week I'm going to focus on leadership and drive just take a step back and create a plan for yourself how much time and you need to give yourself at least a month.
[29:30] I would probably say more a couple of months to prepare like if I look at how I was a few months ago versus now there is no comparison like if sometimes you just need a good couple of months like really get it up group and like it's like it's definitely like training for a marathon like there's not really skimp on it like you have to put in the work.
[29:50] I have I have a third that's kind of like more along the offer side of things so I would say like you know when you do get it offer because you're going to be watching all the amazing content you're going to get one.
[30:00] When you do get an offer in your at that stage where you're like negotiating and stuff like I definitely think it's important to like know that like you know you can always move up from a preliminary offer like they gave you and like even if something sounds great like you shouldn't be like oh I'm going to take the first thing that comes that like I love it great stuff.
[30:18] Trish this was so much fun and again just loads of energy so I'm so excited for everyone to see this and again congrats on the offer that's so exciting.
[30:28] Thank you I'm so excited thank you so much and thank you guys for watching.
