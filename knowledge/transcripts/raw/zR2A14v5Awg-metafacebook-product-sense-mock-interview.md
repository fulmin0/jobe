## Transcript

[00:00] Imagine yourself, you're a product manager,
[00:02] and we will want to feel something in the travel space.
[00:05] What product would you build?
[00:06] Hey, guys, so today we have Abhi
[00:09] check again for product sense because you all asked for him again.
[00:13] So for those who haven't met him in the last video,
[00:16] go check that out, but he'll give us short intro today,
[00:18] and we're going to dive into a product sense mock question today.
[00:22] Hey, Diane, thanks for inviting me.
[00:23] Hey, everyone, this is Abhi Sheikh.
[00:25] I work as Lead Product Manager at Squared,
[00:27] where I'm responsible for the online ordering and delivering
[00:30] for the e-commerce platform for Squared.
[00:32] Right to joining Squared, I was at PayPal for nine years,
[00:34] working as Senior Product Manager there.
[00:37] I'm so excited to be here.
[00:39] It's so good to have you again, and we're going to have some fun today.
[00:42] We're going to be talking about traveling.
[00:45] So let's dive right in.
[00:47] So we're going to cover a product sense question today,
[00:49] which is one of the main questions that will be asked
[00:52] for product design at the Facebook Google of the world.
[00:56] So Abhi Sheikh, today, imagine yourself
[00:58] your product manager, and we will want to build something
[01:00] in the travel space.
[01:02] And let's put Facebook aside entirely,
[01:07] and just imagine that you're a startup.
[01:08] What product would you build?
[01:11] Hmm, awesome.
[01:13] Makes sense.
[01:15] And then just a few clarifying questions,
[01:17] then are there any resourcing, any funding,
[01:21] any geographical constraints that should keep in mind,
[01:23] or I'm free to explore them?
[01:25] You're free to explore the world is your oyster.
[01:29] Awesome.
[01:29] That makes sense.
[01:30] What I'm going to do now is I'll share my screen.
[01:33] So you can trace my thoughts, and we can have
[01:35] a more informed decision and discussion.
[01:38] Awesome.
[01:38] Since this is a pretty broad, open-ended question,
[01:41] and travel space itself is big, I would love to first start
[01:44] with why, like, why do we really want to enter this space?
[01:47] If it really makes sense to enter into travel space
[01:50] in such a time, looking at the macroeconomic conditions
[01:52] and the competitors, et cetera.
[01:55] Then we would look into the travel value chain.
[01:57] Generally, I don't discuss value chains,
[01:59] go straight into the user and problem,
[02:01] but because travel is such an open space,
[02:03] it's a pretty broad area.
[02:04] Let's look at the value chain of travel,
[02:06] and see if we can find a specific niche
[02:08] in which we want to operate,
[02:09] or just want to take travel in general.
[02:13] Would love to establish the mission of a product,
[02:15] business goal, and then I would like to cover target users,
[02:18] who are the users we'll be focusing on.
[02:21] Look at the user journey, look into their problems,
[02:23] and then dive straight into the solutions.
[02:26] If we have time, again, I don't think so be mine,
[02:28] but if we have time, I can also talk about some GTM
[02:31] because it's a totally brand new product.
[02:33] Maybe you'd talk about some go-to-market strategies
[02:35] if we have time, but low priority.
[02:36] Yeah, wasn't mixed in.
[02:37] That's a good idea.
[02:38] Awesome, make sense.
[02:40] Hey, then let's quickly talk about the why.
[02:44] So if we're to enter into travel space,
[02:46] I think the first thing I generally look
[02:48] whenever I'm entering into a totally new product space
[02:50] is the total municipal market.
[02:52] Like is this problem or is the space big enough?
[02:55] I don't have full stats on me,
[02:57] but then travel we can intuitively tell
[02:58] is a very big space.
[02:59] It's a billion dollar industry in itself.
[03:02] Other factor to look at when entering a new space
[03:04] is not just a time, but also the growth.
[03:06] While the target market may be big,
[03:08] but is it shrinking or is it growing?
[03:10] A while travel had its own blips due to COVID,
[03:13] and it was for a while, but we see from the news
[03:16] that travel is picking back up.
[03:18] Travel solves a very inherent human need
[03:20] that they really want to explore the world, spend a free time.
[03:24] And I don't see a reason why travel would shrink
[03:27] unless we have any big disasters like COVID on the air.
[03:30] I think travel industry on a whole will keep on flowing.
[03:33] The macro conditions were not viable.
[03:35] If I were to start this maybe a year ago,
[03:37] I would have doubled thoughts,
[03:38] but as pandemic is easing,
[03:40] economies opening, flights are back on.
[03:41] People are traveling again.
[03:42] I think macro economic conditions are good enough.
[03:45] There are a bunch of competitors in this space
[03:47] who are solving for travel,
[03:49] but I would like to explore them deeply in the value chain
[03:51] because most of these competitors
[03:53] act at a different level of travel.
[03:55] And then I would see like if there is any unserved
[03:57] niche here in the value chain that we can target actually.
[04:00] So let me dry straight into the value chain basically.
[04:03] So if you look at the full value chain for travel,
[04:05] I think it starts with discovery.
[04:07] So the first thing is,
[04:08] I have to discover where I'm going to travel.
[04:10] It can be totally intuitive
[04:11] or I'm looking out for inspiration.
[04:12] And players acting in this field of discovery,
[04:15] in-stab, which has become very popular
[04:17] with a lot of their travel content
[04:18] and travel influencers coming in.
[04:20] FB, size-like, advice,
[04:21] or maybe even local magazines that I may subscribe to
[04:24] like I'm at as a discovery channel for me,
[04:26] that what are some of the places I would love to go to?
[04:28] The first point in the decision.
[04:30] And then basically comes the journey part.
[04:32] I have to plan my journey,
[04:33] I have to do the booking,
[04:35] Expedia, flight websites like United
[04:38] or trip actions,
[04:39] act a lot in this space.
[04:41] Then comes the state part that there are players
[04:44] who are optimizing your stay,
[04:46] stay better, stay with locals,
[04:48] etc.
[04:48] Airbnb, booking.com,
[04:50] local hotels act in this space.
[04:51] And then the core part comes in around your IT-native
[04:54] and local experiences.
[04:55] What would exactly you do when you reach the destination?
[04:58] What are some of the activities that you do?
[05:00] So there are two guides.
[05:02] There are some local players.
[05:04] There are some very niche players in this space.
[05:06] I remember going to Hawaii
[05:08] and when I was trying to go to Routuhana,
[05:09] I found an app called Shaka Guide
[05:11] that is just responsible for telling me
[05:13] what are the different spots at Routuhana.
[05:15] So it built out a full itinerary of Routuhana,
[05:17] but it was very niche and very local.
[05:20] I am again, it may be,
[05:22] I would do more research
[05:23] when I'm actually building this space,
[05:24] but I would love to see are there any other players?
[05:26] So far my assumption is,
[05:27] I haven't found any strong player
[05:29] that can help you with local experiences in IT-native.
[05:32] Airbnb is trying to do that,
[05:33] but it has very limited activities
[05:36] and it doesn't build your full IT-native.
[05:38] It's very disjointed experience
[05:39] that will tell you one or two activities
[05:41] that you can do in isolation.
[05:42] And then finally, it has,
[05:45] it is a trend now.
[05:46] It wasn't a few years ago, 10 years ago,
[05:48] is once you travel,
[05:49] have you even traveled,
[05:50] if you haven't really shared your travel memories
[05:52] and photographs?
[05:53] So people tend to come back
[05:54] and share it with their friends, families,
[05:56] FPNists are doing a lot in that space
[05:58] and they are the clear winner.
[05:59] I think at one point,
[06:00] Flicker was very popular
[06:01] where people used to share a lot of images.
[06:04] When I look at this value chain,
[06:06] I look at this competitors,
[06:07] I, you know, very intuitively,
[06:09] I can see this area is right now underserved.
[06:12] There are not a lot of competitors.
[06:13] It's also an area which is the core part of traveling
[06:16] unless you really want to just go in,
[06:19] relax at a resort for five, six days,
[06:22] which is again,
[06:22] maybe a small population.
[06:23] I think this still becomes a core part of travel.
[06:26] Traveling your itinerary,
[06:27] what exactly are the things you're going to do there?
[06:29] Maybe three days or a week when you're staying there
[06:31] and what are some of the good,
[06:32] interesting local experiences
[06:34] that you would go in experience there?
[06:36] Mm-hmm.
[06:37] And you mentioned,
[06:38] yeah, please go ahead.
[06:39] That Airbnb,
[06:40] because they have their Airbnb experiences
[06:41] and you mentioned there's not like that many,
[06:46] that much supply.
[06:47] Can you extrapolate a bit on that?
[06:48] Yeah, let me talk about that.
[06:49] So if you see Airbnb,
[06:51] it provides stay
[06:52] and I think Airbnb really found the gap in the market.
[06:54] Nobody's really doing well.
[06:55] So maybe that's why they enter into that.
[06:57] But the way they provide the experiences,
[06:59] say I'm going to Portland,
[06:59] I can find what are the different experiences in Portland,
[07:02] maybe in archery class,
[07:03] a cooking class, et cetera.
[07:05] But what Airbnb feels to still do that
[07:07] is build out my good itinerary or good plan.
[07:09] You are here for three days.
[07:10] These are all the activities that you can do in three days.
[07:13] What it provides are a couple of experiences here and there.
[07:16] And I won't say the list is exhausted.
[07:18] The list is pretty small.
[07:20] The list is also dependent on the service providers
[07:24] that are on their platform
[07:25] that they have signed up with.
[07:26] So it's a good experience.
[07:29] It's not a great experience.
[07:30] It's still disjointed in my opinion.
[07:32] And there's still a lot that can be done here.
[07:34] Compared to other parts,
[07:35] like you know, flight booking,
[07:38] you have flight booking,
[07:40] you have journey booking app.
[07:41] I can basically build out something
[07:42] that can optimize for cost and saving,
[07:44] but those might be small improvement.
[07:46] It will not be a big jump.
[07:47] It's a small improvisation.
[07:49] Whereas this is an area where I see
[07:51] we can have a leap in terms of what we can innovate
[07:53] and what we can build.
[07:55] Interesting.
[07:56] Yeah, now this sounds fun.
[07:57] Definitely like you said, local experiences
[08:00] is what makes or break the experience.
[08:03] Yeah.
[08:03] Good.
[08:04] And I also feel this is a good entry into the market
[08:06] because other places as we see is already crowded.
[08:08] I think if you enter here well,
[08:11] and if you're able to win the market,
[08:12] it's very easy to go on the edges and seas.
[08:14] Like not only have built your local experience,
[08:16] I'll also find you a way to stay there
[08:17] or also find you a way to reach there.
[08:19] So I think based on what we have seen so far,
[08:23] this makes a best sense to enter the market with.
[08:25] Mm.
[08:26] Okay.
[08:27] Now that we have left a mind
[08:28] that this is an area where we'll be entering in,
[08:30] restaurant journey, finding users, problems,
[08:33] and solution will be restricted into this very niche.
[08:35] Okay.
[08:36] That will be going in.
[08:37] All right.
[08:38] So, I think when we go there, let's do a mission.
[08:40] I love to do this exercise before building out any new product.
[08:43] It just helps to inspire the team,
[08:45] inspire everyone and bring them on the same page.
[08:48] I also believe mission is something that transcends
[08:50] more than you or just your product.
[08:51] Like it's, it's a bigger, higher calling
[08:54] that you should take care of.
[08:55] And I generally spend a lot of time writing mission,
[08:57] but I'll try to do best, making it quickly.
[09:01] Give me a minute to think about the good mission.
[09:04] Okay.
[09:05] Not the best mission statement,
[09:06] but some of the few wordings I wanted to focus
[09:08] on was beautiful memories.
[09:10] I guess your local experience are the part of the journey
[09:12] that you remember the most.
[09:13] Like if you asked me, I may not remember my Delta flight
[09:16] from San Jose to New York,
[09:17] but I would always remember the things I saw in New York.
[09:21] And because we want to show local experiences,
[09:24] something unique, I probably wanted to add something more
[09:26] about a unique lens and unique perspective.
[09:28] There's a way you travel like a tourist,
[09:30] you go there, go to all the touristy spot,
[09:32] but maybe there are activities where you go to a local pub,
[09:35] you understand the history of how it was built,
[09:37] get to meet local people, talk to them,
[09:39] experience and understand the culture.
[09:40] So if I were to write my mission,
[09:41] it would focus on these key pillars,
[09:43] making beautiful memories,
[09:44] because this is the part of journey that you always remember
[09:48] seeing the local world, understanding the unique lens.
[09:51] So probably this is somewhere roughly where my mission would be,
[09:54] that would inspire my team and my people
[09:57] to build experience that delights user that makes them happy
[09:59] and that makes everlasting long,
[10:01] beautiful memories.
[10:02] Hmm.
[10:03] And when we say unique lens,
[10:06] is that supposed to be pointing to the local lens?
[10:10] That's, yeah, that's basically pointing to some local experiences
[10:14] and local lens that are not that commonly known.
[10:17] Got it.
[10:18] Okay. Nice.
[10:19] Since I'm early in the stage,
[10:20] I would focus a lot more on adoption as my business goal,
[10:23] finding a product market fit and would not like to focus on revenue.
[10:26] And I can quickly define adoption is basically
[10:29] one experience booked on the platform.
[10:33] I'll probably keep it to one because travel may not be a daily thing
[10:37] or maybe a weekly thing,
[10:39] may not even a monthly thing,
[10:40] it may be a by monthly thing.
[10:41] So probably someone is booking one experience of the platform.
[10:44] I can say that they might have adopted the platform
[10:46] and you have to go through the full journey of experiencing.
[10:49] So that's my business goal,
[10:50] focusing on adoption,
[10:51] not on revenue,
[10:52] because we are early in the cycle and want to look at product market fit.
[10:55] Wanted to make sure Diana,
[10:56] if we are okay with the business goal and we're in the same page
[10:59] and it makes sense.
[11:00] Yeah.
[11:02] So one experience booked on the platform across the time period,
[11:06] like a food,
[11:07] get our data science to measure this.
[11:09] Yeah, yeah.
[11:10] That makes sense.
[11:11] I think a good point.
[11:13] I think I would just basically since I'm starting out,
[11:18] I will just look at maybe a monthly.
[11:21] Yeah.
[11:22] Maybe I'll look at a more like a monthly number.
[11:24] I will try.
[11:25] And again, this is more of a full North Star in goal setting exercises.
[11:28] I would not define my North Star here.
[11:30] I'm just taking more from a business perspective.
[11:32] I will look at overall adoption numbers on a monthly basis,
[11:34] how many experiences that have been booked and delivered to our users.
[11:38] Okay.
[11:39] Sounds good.
[11:40] Awesome.
[11:41] Let's go and quickly move into our target users.
[11:43] So for my target users,
[11:46] I will basically start with broad category and then I'll just go and start narrow down.
[11:53] All right.
[11:54] I'm basically divided into two parts.
[11:56] One other service provider in the travel industry.
[11:58] So if I'm talking about my niche of local experiences and iteries,
[12:02] there are players who are service providers who provide service.
[12:04] And then they'll basically be the consumers or the travelers.
[12:07] So let me look into travelers and then we'll just think about who do we want to prioritize and who do we want to focus on?
[12:12] Okay.
[12:13] On the travelers side, you know, there are many lenses on which I can slice and dice this whole traveler thing.
[12:19] Let me, let me start with this, you know, like a more common one.
[12:23] Generally, we tried to keep our target segment as me see mutually exclusive and comprehensive.
[12:29] On the first look, it might look hey, if friends is also a group, family is also a group.
[12:33] But one thing to keep in mind is they are still different because with family,
[12:37] you may have a recurring theme, like I may be traveling with the same set of people that I'm traveling with family or largely say same set of people.
[12:43] I know that habit and preference slightly more and better.
[12:46] Whereas in friends in a group, this is not, this is a dynamic group.
[12:49] My friends can keep changing.
[12:50] So that may determine what type of solution I'll be building in and also my tolerance for comfort, my appetite for exploration might be very different in a family versus friends in the solar travelers altogether, different class of users.
[13:03] Okay.
[13:04] Now, I think my first set of question would be, hey, do I want to build something for service provider or do I want to build something for travelers?
[13:10] And that's a very typical marketplace problem.
[13:12] Do you focus on seller first or do you focus on buyer first?
[13:15] I think in this case, basically, we'd love to focus more on the travelers because that will be the core USB of our platform.
[13:21] If I'm able to provide a good experience to my travelers, service providers will very easily come service providers basically look for avenues where they can get more business.
[13:30] And if my certain app has more value for travelers and they keep coming in, I think it will be great value for service provider also to solve the chicken egg problem.
[13:38] You can always precede service providers like you can take the listing from craklest or from other websites other places you can easily reach out.
[13:47] The effort to be on the platform is much lower for service provider compared to the traveler like why would I book something from here also.
[13:55] Yeah, basically, so basically going back to the core marketplace principle focusing on where the end value lies the end value lies with the travelers that's in the interest for service provider interest for our platform.
[14:05] I would love to focus on travelers first not saying I ignore service provider, but you would want to start to build the best experience for travelers.
[14:13] Now, yeah, any questions so far?
[14:16] No. All right. Then basically within travelers, I think I would like to go further down because maybe when I'm starting, I would like to focus more.
[14:23] So between families, solo travelers and friends in group, I would probably try to look at maybe say.
[14:30] My major deciding factor if I want to do a weighted average, my major deciding factor will be reach and frequency of use because I focus is more on adoption.
[14:38] I will keep ARPU more as a typewriter in the sense because I don't want to go for a market where even in the future, I may not receive a lot of revenue.
[14:45] So if certain certain segment has a good revenue potential, that's the niche where I would want to grow test and validate and see a product market.
[14:53] So I would do a very quick t-shirt sizing. I'm not doing weighted average for the time and simplicity, but in reality, we actually go with weighted averages look at more quantitative research in the market.
[15:03] So starting with family.
[15:08] Reach is large frequency. I would say medium and then average revenue large and I'll explain the rational why I'm thinking it that way.
[15:18] So for family, the reach is large because just looking at the average population, if I see people who are married, people who have family with kids, this is probably a much larger segment.
[15:28] The frequency of use might be smaller compared to the others in the sense because sometimes family may be constrained by spring holidays, wind provocations, summer vacation kids going to school.
[15:37] AbraShavanyi per user for families typically higher because they value comfort, value the safety of the family, a lot more compared to the others.
[15:45] Solo travelers is still a pretty small niche.
[15:50] The frequency of use, I can say it's up to medium, medium or small. The reason why I'd say large is because solo travel cohort as such itself is not always unique.
[15:59] You may be solo traveler 80% of the time, but sometimes you may switch cohorts and go on a couple of trips with your friends.
[16:05] There are very few solo travelers who are like doing it all the time and that's more as a professional job.
[16:11] ARPU, I would say it's medium to small solo travelers are more open to try group and shared experience to remove that loneliness for certain time.
[16:23] Group again, medium frequency of use large because the group is dynamic, it keeps changing hands, different people can keep coming in.
[16:30] So a group cohort as a whole typically would have a higher frequency of use, they may not be bounded by a school of children or spring breaks, etc. over a period of time and we can take more annual trips.
[16:42] I wish revenue per user would be small but because it's a high ticket size, the group by hole can bring a high ticket size so I'm just keeping it as a medium.
[16:50] Like if you break down to individual user in a group, their capability to pay might be smaller because they may not be open to experiences because they can experience a lot of things as a group together.
[16:59] But when you consider a whole group like five people, four people going together, even if they take one of your experience or one of your product because of the ticket size, the revenue may come be higher.
[17:09] So, four group would it not be comparative for our two as family then?
[17:18] It would be compatible to family then but our hypothesis is if I'm a family member, you may want to prioritize the comfort and the safety of your kids and everyone more than the others.
[17:30] And as a group because they are so many people, let me just do pop up even if I sit on a beach and do nothing as a friend we can sit by one five talk play games, there are a lot more things as a group you can do.
[17:41] And then safety, everything may not be concerned for people people may take shared accommodation, multiple people can stay within a room, they can take a large house, say so overall, I think intuitively the average spend of a family for travel is sometimes most of the time larger than a single person.
[17:59] A similar size group.
[18:02] Yeah, okay.
[18:05] All right, I think just very looking quantitatively and qualitatively, I would probably go with family.
[18:13] I think going back, I think one thing that I miss discussing is on the travelers, I should have also broken it down as a.
[18:22] I know that it matters now, but what is important to note is leisure and then business travelers right and we don't need to do the size again because I think business travelers are start of time they go there for a very specific purpose.
[18:34] And they may not have enough time or a high frequency of use of whatever product they're building so I think this prioritization still makes sense, I would still want to focus on leisure and focus on family and maybe maybe not think about business.
[18:45] I think the only thing about local experiences, yes, they might not have that much time to participate in that exactly.
[18:54] Any question, I know before I move into user journey and quickly start with problems.
[18:58] No, it's very clear.
[19:00] Okay, awesome.
[19:01] All right, quickly on a user journey.
[19:04] If I am planning a trip for my family, I would maybe have booked my flights, I've booked my hotel, I have decided maybe it's I'm staying there for five, five day, four nights or whatever frequency.
[19:15] The next thing comes up, okay, what are some of the local experiences that I would share.
[19:19] So probably I would be doing research.
[19:23] Call my friends basically try to ask them about it over a period of time, I think social validation and social proof has become more and more important.
[19:33] Especially with a lot of people traveling, they're seeding the information and again going for my personal experience, I tend to talk to my friends who have been at the place, my friends talk to me if I've been to a place and they try to make a personal recommendation a lot more or take a recommendation within my own social group, maybe my friends or remote friends, etc.
[19:52] I would research call my friends.
[19:57] Look at safety.
[20:00] Re-reviews like is this family friendly place is it okay.
[20:03] I take a typical user journey. This is not representative of everyone. Some people like do some sort of research call their friends.
[20:10] Look and check the reviews like what are some of the activities that are family friendly like if there's a pub crawl to that's happening probably not the best place I would like to take my two kids and my wife to.
[20:20] Land things out take feedback from family.
[20:23] Finalize experience. This is one user journey couple of others more on the outliers side can be I don't plan anything do a basic check go to my place talk to the concierge at my hotel call a local guide and then just tell them to plan everything out so typical user journey.
[20:39] More or less the other same your intensity of research would vary on on the other journeys, but this is typically what I would say a typical user would follow.
[20:47] Does that make sense and can I move ahead to the problems.
[20:49] That makes sense wondering on the experience side is there.
[20:55] I think else in the journey.
[21:02] Yeah, I would say on the experience side like if I want yeah we can we can go ahead and break it down to further things like.
[21:09] Yeah, I would say when you're experiencing actually you may figure out that I plan to go to a museum I need to buy a ticket maybe I need to stand in a queue to get that ticket.
[21:18] I need to keep my family together say I'm in Disneyland and there are a lot of there's a big crowd I need to ensure my family's together and say.
[21:25] When you're experiencing for the full day you might have to solve for food and maybe looking at for recommendations for what are some of the top local restaurants where I can eat.
[21:33] Take take pick together how do I store all the pigs if I'm listing a museum or any place of historical significance and we want to know about history of the place as a history buff need to know about some more information about the place while I'm experiencing it sometimes these things.
[21:48] May enrich your experience overall knowing some background about the place may not be applicable for everyone but some people really value these this part.
[21:55] Okay.
[21:57] Hi let's go into the problem and dive deep into them I think because we have already you know we went into a very specific niche I think all our problems are related to itery and your local experiences.
[22:08] So building out the itery on the place requires a lot of research and effort I think this is a broad problem.
[22:13] I think this is a big challenge in itself.
[22:18] Another problem can be like keeping children busy at the event is challenging this is specifically true for families like they are going and seeing a museum or they're wasting a national part.
[22:36] Getting children busy is a big problem for them and sometimes this becomes a determining factor on how good or bad their experiences it sometimes ruins the entire experience and not able to look at that miss out on a lot of local recommendations which are not popular I think I don't know a lot of people are guilty and I'm guilty that when I go to Hawaii I travel it and I come back and rest oh there was one thing that I really missed out is just because I didn't have lot of good connections on nobody told me or that place did not have a high SEO or search engine optimize.
[23:05] So search engine optimization I couldn't just find it so a lot of people miss out on local recommendations which are not popular and the final thing is lots of back and forth with the family on getting on the same page like hey this is the plan do you want to review it and there are not a lot of good ways you do that basically as a person I build out the plan I share it with my family members they look at it there's a bit back and forth there.
[23:28] Although I know the preferences and what they like there is no easy way for me to know whether this activity would be loved by them or whether they would like it or not there's a lot of discussion and back and forth which further takes into time takes yeah it's really challenging and assuming you haven't planned well in advance you go on a page you go to the concierge and they present you something with local options getting on the same page may take some time and that may you're just basically wasting time on your vacation which you might have spent enjoying out there.
[23:56] So these are some of the problems that I that I could find out I think this problem is pretty broad I think if you're if you're okay with that down on fine if you want we can break it into for this problem as well up to you okay let's go with that in the interest of time and let me let me just go ahead and try to prioritize that the way I try to prioritize the problems is just looking at two important parameters number of users and depth of pain is this problem affecting a small number of users for a large number of users.
[24:26] So is it a shallow pain are there substitute that I can look for or is it actually a very deep pain that I'm going to try to solve.
[24:34] So building it I think it applies to a lot of users at some point of time you would have to figure out what are the places you would go what are the places you would select what are the places you would pride or experiences that you would prioritize that's a lot of cognitive load on just normal human being one not used today to research or building out that and the depth of pain is pretty large and I can tell it from my experience or my experience from my friends.
[24:55] We just throwing the ball at each other like hey can you plan can you plan so keeping children busy I kept it small because not everyone may have small children that need attention some may not have in families some may have bigger children who don't need and don't
[25:08] attention although the number of users is a small the depth of pain is large because this problem is not frequently occurring but when it occurs it's really a big pain missing out a lot of local
[25:18] people are not able to do that. So I would say a medium not everyone does that some do that and whenever that happens the depth is not big like hey I visited nine out of 10 places if I missed out one place like is it that big of a deal breaker would I be sad about that it's I would say some minor inconvenience lot of back and forth with family and getting to same page I would say I would keep it small lot of time different people may not have a point of view or point of opinion they said hey just figure out the best path and we'll be on the same page.
[25:47] A big problem or like you would enter into a fight or cancel the trip because you did not settle on a problem questionable name I brought a getting fights all the time all the time.
[25:58] I mean there are several reasons you can get into fight to fight okay if you're getting fight at this thing the problem is bigger that's probably awesome cool I think it's very intuitive it wasn't a hard prioritization that I have to look at I think probably the first one building out the
[26:16] territory of places which require a lot of research and effort I would just say that basically stands as a true winner over here so let me prioritize this problem and try to solve for this and these
[26:26] come as a second or third milestone in our solution all right so here are some of the solutions that I quickly jot it down that will happen to discuss with you let's start with the first one I just try to give every solution more like a code name or a nickname my name is that don't just no it's great is short and memory
[26:45] all right so the first solution is local lens basically what we would do is you enter your destination and then what will we do is connect you to the local guides out there that can plan the journey into end.
[26:58] I see this as more as a white love treatment and maybe for the most premium users like I don't want to spend any time in research you just tell me out there and then I can just hit look at the review of the guide hit next and then that guide can plan of custom might need for me based on what I want to do whether I want to
[27:14] surprise my wife on a yacht trip at a sunset cruise or give a very lovely experience to my kids the guides can do that for me.
[27:22] And as the guide going with you along or it's mostly they plan for you and then you will figure out.
[27:29] We can be configured on a type of service like a guide can be a concentration only or a guide can be along with you only depends on what service type the guides provide and I think the local guide market is very fragmented like you go to a place and you find a market I haven't seen any product and solution out there that have tried to
[27:44] combine the pool of guides together and bring them on a platform.
[27:49] Trip bunny you enter the destination you enter the budget.
[27:54] The time that you have and this trip bunny builds out the entire schedule and plan for you so if you are going out for four days your budget is like a hundred dollars per day here are the list of activities that you can do here is a paid activity free activity that you can do and you can always go ahead and change it but will give you a strong template and a full schedule to start with over a period of time that can look
[28:14] at your concentration your allergies your preferences you can connect your social profile and then I can also look at what kind of person you are a mountain person a beach person a party person a city person etc so a lot of potential for this idea to further grow travel buddies inside enter destination and get picks and insights from your friends like it can look into my social graph all my friends who went to Hawaii and figure out what are the different places that they have been to I can look at the personal I speak if I like someone I can always call them I will quickly
[28:44] call out a trade off here it's the called the cold start problem because I need to have lot of my friends on the platform I need to allow users to connect the social profile and give me the odd permission to connect so it will have a cold start problem and we have to figure out what is that incentive because of which people will connect their accounts.
[29:02] Another thing is trip marketplace think like it can be a platform to share it really I build a lot of Factory I shared it with a lot of my friends for free of cost but I would love it is a marketplace where all these custom Mitres I built for my trip I can just share it out and maybe I can get rewarded again some points maybe virtual point that I can redeem for some awards or some discounts later which is very easy in the travel space as you get a lot of referral bonus and referral margins so these points can convert into valuable and so if I want to go to Hawaii I just go with these numbers and they can go directly to Hawaii and I will go.
[29:32] how I custom my tree trips and I can see a bunch of them.
[29:35] This is much better than going on to Google searching multiple blogs,
[29:38] not having credibility, and I can see a rating interview.
[29:41] Finally, MapQuest, you enter a destination.
[29:44] I'll figure out what are the different spots there.
[29:47] And then you can build a full itinerary along with pit stops,
[29:50] food joints where you can get fuel.
[29:52] I think MapQuest is more a map-based solution for road trips.
[29:56] Again, if I target market, maybe if I'm starting out in the US,
[29:59] where road trips are pretty popular,
[30:00] and road trips are pretty popular with families going to National Park,
[30:04] this can become a very strong niche solution for people going on a road trip.
[30:07] You don't have to plan anything.
[30:08] Just sit in your car and leave your home,
[30:10] and the app has everything figured out for you.
[30:12] God, does it different between MapQuest and Travel Bunny?
[30:16] Travel Bunny, I think, is not a full map-based solution,
[30:21] and it's more generic in nature.
[30:23] I think whereas MapQuest focuses a lot more on your road trips,
[30:28] and focus more on fuels, food joints.
[30:31] Amazing.
[30:32] I can see a world where they both can converge,
[30:35] like much later into the future,
[30:37] but I think to start with, probably keep them a little separate.
[30:40] OK.
[30:41] So what I'm going to do now is quickly do a quick prioritization
[30:44] based on reach, impact, and effort.
[30:46] Is this solution applicable to a wider audience, a smaller audience?
[30:49] Is it more impactful, getting the closer to their goals,
[30:52] and then effort to build them?
[30:53] And then we'll do a quick prioritization on that.
[30:55] Again, we'll do a same t-shirt sizing.
[30:58] Local lens, I'll say the reaches small, again,
[31:01] this thing may come with its own premium cost and premium charge.
[31:04] I see it more of a wide-club support
[31:06] for a premium users on the platform.
[31:09] I don't see a reach to be very high.
[31:11] I mean, these options are still available,
[31:12] but a lot of people may use it.
[31:15] So I would say the reaches small.
[31:17] Impact can be pretty high because, hey,
[31:18] if you can get someone to work for you
[31:22] and build the whole thing for you, the impact can be high.
[31:24] I thought, yeah, I see there, you have a question.
[31:27] Yeah, go ahead.
[31:28] What's the difference between reach and impact?
[31:32] Reach can be number of people.
[31:34] Your solution is applicable to impact and talk more about
[31:37] how deeply the solution solves your problem.
[31:39] Like, does it solve?
[31:40] I see.
[31:41] Like, does it solve more?
[31:43] And again, if we had set up our own North Star
[31:46] mattress and KPIs, I would set and look at
[31:49] how much closer to our goals and KPIs
[31:51] is impact is taking us to.
[31:53] I've also added a sort of adoption lens,
[31:55] like I also see in terms of adoption, where it will work.
[31:59] Correct.
[32:00] But quickly, yeah, the reason I said it small,
[32:02] it can be more of a premium white-cut service.
[32:04] Impact is super high.
[32:06] Effort to build is small, but effort to scout local guides
[32:10] convinced them to be on a platform.
[32:12] And because they are more of a fragmented market,
[32:14] getting them off a platform may be a significant effort.
[32:16] So I put the effort as medium over here.
[32:20] Trip money, definitely high reach because it's a very
[32:22] generic solution that takes in my choices and preference
[32:26] and build out an item for me.
[32:27] Impact can be pretty high, at least that's what we aim for.
[32:30] It will solve all your problem.
[32:32] The effort to build might be very high in the sense,
[32:34] because even if I start with a very small market,
[32:37] say just California, and I need to have a lot of destination,
[32:42] I need to find out what are the local things there.
[32:44] So there's a lot of legwork to build out this thing.
[32:48] And then I have to build out the whole matching algorithm.
[32:51] And probably want to find out some USB where I can learn from
[32:55] my users so that I don't face a fear of disruption.
[32:59] Because I think this idea, if I just do it on a very simple rule-based thing,
[33:02] can be easily copied and distributed.
[33:04] So I need to find that unique thing in my algorithm
[33:06] that can make it accurate.
[33:07] And I would say they've got to be pretty high to do that
[33:11] just to find out the local location.
[33:12] Also, the other problem with going very niche,
[33:14] very small is, hey, trip finder just for San Francisco,
[33:18] I think adoption would take a lot more time.
[33:20] If I just go very small here.
[33:23] Trip buddies inside, the reach might be very small,
[33:27] just because of the cold-sat problem,
[33:28] not a lot of people may agree to share their data with a platform.
[33:34] As such, building this solution, we have a small reach.
[33:36] Kind of a medium impact, because the data will be very unstructured,
[33:40] coming from my friends.
[33:41] They may not be covering everything.
[33:42] Even if I look at their data,
[33:44] I may not make any strong conclusions on how do I plan my trip.
[33:47] Like I still might do some more research.
[33:49] And so it solves my pain point, but not to a complete extent.
[33:52] But I would say it would be pretty small,
[33:54] because I literally cannot go in convince books.
[33:56] I think it's just more about the building the engine on platform,
[33:59] and basically doing some more effort on the marketing side.
[34:04] Trip marketplace, medium reach,
[34:09] more in the sense of,
[34:12] my platform will be restricted by the number of people
[34:14] I can get on my platform with custom ITeries.
[34:16] Like it may happen that I may get a lot of I-TRAISE about Hawaii,
[34:19] very less I-TRAISE about California and such.
[34:21] So even if I go in a niche market,
[34:23] I will still be constrained by the number of people who build out the ITeries
[34:26] and share on the platforms.
[34:27] I would say a medium reach.
[34:28] The impact can be super high if we have a strong rating and strong
[34:31] wedding process in the beginning.
[34:33] Effort can also be very high in actually building out the whole marketplace platform.
[34:36] If that's the MVP of a product,
[34:38] having a service provider side and a service to see my side.
[34:42] MapQuest,
[34:44] a medium reach,
[34:46] maybe for target market, is used to begin with,
[34:48] whether a lot of road trips.
[34:49] It's still not as high as a trip money because again,
[34:52] it's again into niche of road trips.
[34:55] So I wouldn't say that reach would be very high.
[34:57] Impact can be pretty good.
[34:59] Effort will be pretty high again because I would have to integrate with map-based API,
[35:03] figure out the different nodes and point, find out the optimal path.
[35:06] So I can see,
[35:08] if I have to say I would probably even go excel because building out a map-based solution
[35:11] and finding out pit stops and food joints and fuel can be pretty intensive.
[35:15] I think the two candidates that stand out are trip money and trip marketplace,
[35:21] similar impact, similar effort, but I guess the reach for trip money might be slightly higher
[35:26] than trip marketplace because we can quickly out source a lot of information in-house
[35:30] and can ensure the quality.
[35:31] Getting a lot of quality,
[35:32] itemies out might be tough and take more time and the reach will be more.
[35:37] So what about the effort between these two?
[35:40] Like if now we're comparing these two in terms of effort,
[35:44] do we think they're the same level of effort that you labeled it for large?
[35:49] Yeah, now that I have an extra characteristic of excel, probably I would say this will be large
[35:54] trending more towards
[35:57] excel in my opinion.
[35:58] I'll let me give me, let me pause and think about a little bit more to go back to my thoughts.
[36:04] I'll probably keep them the same, because what I'm looking for is non-just the
[36:07] engineering effort, but I'm thinking about more of the launch effort.
[36:11] While destination building is more of an in-house team, I may spend a lot more time on the actual
[36:17] build. The build here would be slightly similar, because I would have to build out more of a
[36:21] marketplace model and a platform model compared to more of an in-house first-party solution.
[36:27] I would also have to, and this might be easier because I may not have to focus on
[36:31] as deep an algorithm or mapping as I'm doing in trip money, but at the same time,
[36:35] my effort would also be increased by sourcing out these people who would basically be the seed
[36:40] sellers on my platform, like, hey, inviting a lot of people to build out the itemies.
[36:45] Maybe I can see it this with a lot of, you know, like in-house account, like how Amazon does,
[36:50] they have a WS retail entity, which acts like a third-party seller, but it belongs to Amazon.
[36:54] Like maybe that's a good idea. I can start with trip market place with that.
[36:58] In that case, my effort can probably be medium. It might be a smaller effort.
[37:02] It depends on the incentives. You mentioned your bugs that you might incentivize them with points,
[37:08] or maybe they can translate those points into things they can buy, travel with.
[37:15] Yeah. Yeah. The point is right. When you open the platform of incentive, there has to be a proper
[37:19] betting structure. Like I cannot post any content without review. Like what people have profane
[37:23] language, abusing, they put profane images. In the beginning when I'm going, I have a brand to
[37:30] build. I would not be comfortable putting out any content without properly betting and thoroughly
[37:34] looking at it. So the amount of research I'll be doing in TripBunny for a particular place,
[37:40] I would have to do almost similar research here because I'll be betting what the users are
[37:44] proposing on the platform. At least initially, over a period of time, I will have certain
[37:48] power users who I can have more relaxed criteria compared to others, or build out a foul language
[37:54] detection algorithm, etc. But I think in the beginning, my effort would be similar.
[38:00] Where I said the effort can be minimum is where I was thinking that maybe I can see this place,
[38:05] see the marketplace with a lot of bought entries like a build out like a few users,
[38:11] and then they can be sharing the itemities over the time. So I can see the marketplace with some
[38:14] of the initial users who are in house content writers. That way, that might become a little bit
[38:20] medium. But again, I think overall, yeah, if I were to do that, yeah, I think it might be better.
[38:31] So I'm right now divided probably between TripBunny and Trip Marketplace. Give me 30 seconds and
[38:37] probably I can think about more way to prioritize which of the solution I'll be going forward.
[38:42] Does that make sense? I think if I'm thinking my region impact would be similar,
[38:48] my region is smaller over here, but my effort is smaller. I think another thing I would do,
[38:51] and look at is my starting business goal, which I've sent is adoption. I would probably go forward
[38:56] and see which one of them will lead to better adoption. The only challenge with I see with the
[38:59] Trip Marketplace is the whole idea of trust. If I'm coming into a particular marketplace and I see
[39:04] itemities by different people, do I trust them? It's something that we need to be tested out initially,
[39:10] right? And adoption may take much longer because first we have to build a trust in the market,
[39:15] have people trust out it. Whereas on TripBunny, it's something that has been generated based on
[39:20] user-owned preference, at least from the UX perspective. I enter my destination,
[39:23] budget, and the system basically builds out an activity for me that I can edit in system and
[39:27] go forward with it. I think this one would be closely tied to a brand, may lead to better adoption,
[39:33] and may have lesser adoption concerns and lesser trust in safety concern.
[39:38] Yeah, also I would say there may be also privacy concerns that people may feel that,
[39:43] a lot of strangers may be knowing that I'm purchasing an activity for them that may be I'm going
[39:47] here. Whereas on the TripBunny, it might be restricted within a first-party platform, TripBunny,
[39:52] and I'm sharing my data with only one company. So there may be perceived privacy concerns as well
[39:58] in one scenario versus the other. I think so based on all those factors, I'll probably lead towards
[40:03] TripBunny. Great, shall we deep-rate? Yeah, sure. All right, so let's talk, so many things that worked.
[40:12] I got a chance to write it down, so let me talk through it. So if we started the top,
[40:18] what I like that you did here was the why you basically analyzed how a business would think
[40:26] about entering the space. How big is it? Is it growing macro conditions, competitors? It's kind
[40:31] of funny because I was creating a video for this thing today. Those are the exact points. If you've
[40:37] done consulting before, they cover those things as well. So that just felt very business savvy.
[40:42] Versus, I see a lot of people kind of just speak to, oh, like travel space is interesting,
[40:46] it's exciting, it's like mission-oriented, and that's about it. Well, you always have to realize
[40:51] a business is building this, and they're going to care about the things that you mentioned.
[40:55] Value chain, like you said, this travel space is very broad. So narrowing down seems to have helped
[41:01] you dive into something more specific rather than filling overwhelmed by this whole space. So
[41:07] good job covering all the different competitors and prioritizing the local experiences
[41:14] as to being the space that maybe needs more solutions than the other ones that are a bit crowded.
[41:21] I like the mission as well. Usually the mission is a bit contrived, but I like how you emphasize
[41:27] what you mean by beautiful memories. A lot of times the words itself sound generic, but when you
[41:31] kind of explain it, it's like, okay, I can see how we're going to make or strive for unique.
[41:38] Business goal was really helpful, especially narrowing on the metric, and then you brought
[41:43] that back towards the end to help you prioritize solutions. So that felt good. The who?
[41:54] was then super exhaustive, so great. You probably didn't need to go into service providers.
[42:01] As in write down all those stuff, because we'd actually didn't talk through it.
[42:06] So that is someone where people, you guys can save time if you need.
[42:11] Something I want to call out that you did consistently, and just really stood out was your
[42:17] prioritization. So it was very clear every step of the way why you chose what you chose,
[42:24] why this was like a large versus medium. And I think that stood out to show that your
[42:29] logical thinker that you make decisions based on data versus based on what you feel. So that
[42:36] was consistent in the user part and the pain points part and the solutions part. So that really
[42:40] stood out. So as always, what are two to three tips you would give to people to help them build
[42:46] strength in product sense? Because a lot of people struggle with this type of question.
[42:50] Sure. Interestingly, I wrote an article on LinkedIn a few days back. I think I should check that out.
[42:56] I think I would say focus on why more as a PM, it's a very cliche and very
[43:03] popular saying is fall in love with the problem and not solution. So focus on your why your
[43:07] mission and business goal is really important. I see the best of candidates fail at why. They jump
[43:12] straight into the users, the problem and solution, but focus a lot more on why it shows your strategic
[43:17] side. One good way to develop strong product sense is basically to expose yourself to more
[43:23] products. Look at what are the different products out there. Do a lot of product tear downs.
[43:27] Think about how those problems exist. Typically, we don't get to experience all of them. For example,
[43:34] when I was preparing for my PM interview journey, I don't use a health tracker, a fit built,
[43:38] or an Apple watch at all. I was thinking, what if somebody asked me a question around that? Of course,
[43:42] I can say I don't use that and I may blammer something, but unless I experience it, I wouldn't know
[43:47] about it. So try to get more exposure. Look at what are the interesting apps out there. What are some
[43:52] of the interesting design patterns, product patterns out there? Once you start looking different
[43:56] products in your mind, you will start connecting the dots and start seeing a different pattern.
[44:01] And that basically that's what we call basically a product sense. You look at the problem,
[44:04] you will understand what users might need and what would be a good solution to serve them.
