[00:00] How would you monetize WhatsApp?
[00:02] These products strategy questions are tough,
[00:04] but that's why you have me.
[00:06] So today in this video,
[00:07] I'm going to cover three things.
[00:09] We're going to talk about the framework that you can use to tackle this question.
[00:12] Two, monetization models that you should know.
[00:15] And three, let's think of some monetization features for WhatsApp.
[00:19] So let's kick off with the framework.
[00:21] So I have a four-part framework for you to tackle this question.
[00:24] And as with most questions,
[00:26] it starts off with, let's understand the product.
[00:29] So what is WhatsApp?
[00:31] At the most basic level,
[00:32] WhatsApp is a messaging app that allows people to communicate with one another.
[00:36] How does it work, you might ask?
[00:38] Well, once you've done the app,
[00:39] you would then add your friend's phone numbers.
[00:42] Then you can send messages to them,
[00:44] and you can even create group messages for a group of your friends.
[00:47] And some other features include,
[00:49] you can call your friends,
[00:50] you can send them photos,
[00:52] you can send them voice messages,
[00:54] which is one of my favorite features.
[00:56] And we're seeing a growing number of use cases on the platform.
[00:59] Like even today,
[01:01] people like myself reach out to businesses
[01:03] on WhatsApp to communicate with them.
[01:05] But messaging apps traditionally are pretty tricky to monetize.
[01:09] I mean, WhatsApp initially started monetization
[01:12] by charging people on the app store,
[01:14] was it like 99 cents,
[01:16] 199 in order to download the app.
[01:18] And I remember even at that time,
[01:20] it was bonkers to think that a messaging app with charge users,
[01:24] and I definitely, being in the US where we have I message,
[01:27] was like, I'm not paying for this.
[01:29] So that's one reason why it's so hard
[01:32] to monetize messaging products,
[01:34] because it's pretty commoditized.
[01:36] And hence, people are not used to paying for messaging apps.
[01:40] The other reason it's hard is because messaging
[01:43] is a quite intimate setting.
[01:45] So it's a bit harder to then put commercial activity
[01:48] like ads in your messages.
[01:50] So that's what makes this question especially hard.
[01:53] But again, you have me,
[01:55] so we're gonna tackle this together.
[01:57] Stat number two in this framework is who are the users
[02:00] and what do they need?
[02:01] So when we think about WhatsApp,
[02:03] that you have the consumers,
[02:04] so people like myself, like yourself,
[02:06] who are using the product to mainly communicate
[02:09] with their friends and family.
[02:11] A second set of users are businesses on the platform.
[02:14] So businesses, what do they want to need?
[02:17] They also want to use WhatsApp as a channel
[02:19] to communicate with their customers,
[02:22] but they also want to use it as a channel
[02:24] to come up with lead generation,
[02:26] to get more sales,
[02:28] to allow people to maybe even buy on the WhatsApp platform,
[02:31] rather than having to go outside of the app.
[02:34] Step three, I'm gonna cover some monetization models.
[02:36] And here, I cover them pretty exhaustively,
[02:40] but when you're answering this question,
[02:41] you wanna cover a subset that you think is the best fit
[02:45] for the product at hand.
[02:46] So let's cover the six most common monetization models
[02:50] for businesses.
[02:51] Model number one is probably the most used monetization model,
[02:55] and it's basically a subscription model.
[02:57] So most likely, you're paying a subscription for something,
[03:00] anywhere from products like Netflix or Amazon Prime,
[03:04] to your phone bill.
[03:05] That's a subscription.
[03:07] And nowadays, you have subscriptions for everything.
[03:10] There's one subscription service I saw
[03:11] called the Cat Lady Box.
[03:14] So for you cat lovers,
[03:15] every month they will send you a box of things for your cats.
[03:20] The second model is the freemium model.
[03:22] And this model is free access to the app
[03:25] and serving features, and it gives you a basic version.
[03:28] And then you would upgrade if you wanted more features.
[03:32] So a good example of this is Spotify.
[03:35] So you know, the free version comes with ads,
[03:38] but the paid version comes with out ads,
[03:40] but also allows you to, for example,
[03:42] you Spotify in a different country,
[03:44] allows you to download music,
[03:46] allows you to choose songs on mobile.
[03:48] So they've done a good job of getting people to upgrade
[03:51] to the more advanced version,
[03:54] because they made it pretty annoying
[03:56] to stay on the basic version.
[03:57] The third model is the ads model,
[04:00] which you're probably intimately familiar with,
[04:02] because they are everywhere.
[04:04] Ads has largely powered our media ecosystem.
[04:08] So nowadays, you see ads on things like Google and Facebook,
[04:11] but even before that, ads had powered our consumption of TV.
[04:16] Examples of ads are sponsored listing
[04:18] or even affiliate marketing.
[04:20] And they are especially good for entertainment
[04:23] or media sites that have a ton of traffic.
[04:26] For example, the Google, Facebook's of the world,
[04:29] or Forbes.com, which is getting a bit annoying
[04:33] in terms of the ads.
[04:34] Like, I can't even see the content anymore at this point,
[04:37] or even the Spotify radio like ads.
[04:40] Model number four is transaction fees.
[04:42] And this is the fee a business would charge their customer
[04:48] when they make a transaction on the platform.
[04:50] So think of Airbnb, they will charge the host
[04:53] and the customer a fee to use the platform.
[04:57] Or services like DoorDash.
[04:58] Again, they charge the restaurant a percentage,
[05:01] but they also charge you as a customer
[05:04] for using the platform.
[05:05] Model number five is selling physical goods,
[05:08] digital goods, or a service.
[05:10] So nowadays, for YouTube, you can actually buy stickers
[05:14] to send to your creators,
[05:15] or there's a model of giving free information,
[05:18] but monetizing through getting consulting gigs through it.
[05:21] And model number six is the licensing model.
[05:24] So this traditionally a ton of enterprises
[05:26] like the Oracles of the World,
[05:28] or Salesforce of the World, were using this model.
[05:31] And it's kind of similar to the subscription model,
[05:33] except you would pay for a license for the number of users
[05:37] in the organization that are using it.
[05:40] And you would pay a pretty large amount
[05:42] rather than a monthly subscription model.
[05:45] And this is not an exhaustive list.
[05:48] There could be other monetization models,
[05:50] and I'm curious, what are other models
[05:52] that you've seen using products?
[05:54] And you may realize, as I talk to these models,
[05:57] a lot of businesses tend to mix and match
[06:00] a couple of these different models
[06:01] to ensure they get multiple revenue streams.
[06:04] For example, Spotify, they use both ads
[06:06] and a subscription model,
[06:08] so that they're monetizing both the free users
[06:11] and the paid users.
[06:12] And a lot of platforms have followed suit,
[06:15] like YouTube, they created their YouTube Red,
[06:18] or YouTube TV, whatever they call it nowadays,
[06:21] to get people who want ads out of their content.
[06:25] So from this list of different monetization models,
[06:29] you prioritize a couple that aligns
[06:31] with the users needs and your business goals.
[06:35] And stack number four is the come up
[06:37] with the actual solutions.
[06:39] So here we're gonna have some fun,
[06:40] and think about ways to monetize WhatsApp.
[06:43] So I have four solutions for you.
[06:45] The first is utilizing transaction fees.
[06:47] So business today on WhatsApp,
[06:49] beyond just communicating with customers,
[06:51] they at the end of the communication
[06:53] want people to buy stuff and pay for their services
[06:55] or goods.
[06:56] One solution could be building out these stores
[07:00] on WhatsApp itself that allows customers
[07:03] to complete a sale on the platform.
[07:05] And then from that, WhatsApp could charge the business
[07:08] for the sale happening,
[07:09] and if it wanted to, even the customer.
[07:11] You might first start off with charging the business
[07:14] rather than the customer,
[07:15] because you want to entice customers
[07:16] to create a behavior and a habit of buying on WhatsApp.
[07:20] And the businesses are willing to spend more early on
[07:23] to be listed on the platform.
[07:25] So what does an experience like this sound like?
[07:28] Let's say I wanted to get a facial,
[07:29] and I decided to communicate with the business
[07:32] through WhatsApp.
[07:33] And ideal experience would be at the end,
[07:36] after they answer the question I have,
[07:38] whether they do micro-needling,
[07:40] which for those that don't know,
[07:41] it's poking small holes into your face
[07:45] that's supposed to make it better.
[07:46] Anyways, check it out on YouTube.
[07:47] Is once I'm messaging,
[07:49] once I get the answer that I need from the business,
[07:53] I want to book an appointment and pay for it right there
[07:55] and then.
[07:56] So let's say let's give the business away
[07:58] to allow customers to book directly on WhatsApp.
[08:01] A pro tip for you here, you might be wondering,
[08:04] how do I come up with solutions of ways to monetize?
[08:06] Inspiration is everywhere.
[08:09] Whatever product you're using,
[08:10] there most likely is a monetization model.
[08:14] And hence, look, taking a critical lens
[08:16] on what monetization model they're using it,
[08:19] and how effective it is.
[08:21] Products that I think do really well in inspiration
[08:23] is check out some of the Chinese products like WeChat.
[08:25] They've come up with different ways to monetize.
[08:29] A second solution is utilizing the monetization model
[08:32] of selling physical, digital goods, or services.
[08:35] So when I think about messaging,
[08:36] beyond just text, people want fun ways to message.
[08:39] For example, I'm obsessed with gifts.
[08:42] If you haven't noticed, all my videos have gifts.
[08:45] And I would pay someone on whatever messaging platform
[08:49] I'm using to create maybe custom gifts or gifts
[08:52] that I find funny.
[08:53] So here, WhatsApp might be able to monetize by getting creators
[08:57] to build sticker packs or gift packs or meme packs
[09:02] and sell it on the platform.
[09:03] And this already exists on products like WeChat.
[09:06] So what would the experience look like?
[09:08] Let's say I want special stickers that stand out.
[09:11] It's holiday season, my favorite holiday's Halloween.
[09:15] And let's say I wanted to buy a sticker pack
[09:18] that was very Halloween themed.
[09:20] And here I would go into the sticker store
[09:22] and purchase a sticker pack from a creator
[09:24] for let's say $2 or $5.
[09:27] And the creator then gets a percentage of the money
[09:29] and WhatsApp gets a percentage of that money.
[09:31] Model number three is using the premium model.
[09:35] So here, WhatsApp could create basically the free version
[09:38] of their app as it is today,
[09:40] but they could also create a more advanced version.
[09:43] So for example, when you create a group chat,
[09:45] you have a limitation of how many people
[09:47] can be in that group.
[09:49] So let's say maybe they create a advanced version
[09:51] where that limit doesn't exist
[09:53] or the limit is higher to 1,000 people instead of,
[09:55] I think what is it, 512 people
[09:57] or getting people who really care about privacy
[10:00] to pay for end to end encryption?
[10:02] The end to end encryption might not be a great one
[10:04] because a lot of services now offer that for free.
[10:06] So people might just hop onto those products
[10:08] but you would use some creativity to think
[10:11] what are competitor products
[10:12] that might not have something that you could build
[10:14] at the intersection of what are products,
[10:16] features that people have really been asking for.
[10:18] So what does the experience look like for this?
[10:20] Well, let's say I created a group for a party
[10:24] that was more than 512 people,
[10:26] which I think is the current limit.
[10:28] And at that limit, it would show a little pop up.
[10:30] If you wanna add more people, upgrade to the WhatsApp Pro version.
[10:34] And idea number four is again, using the transaction fees.
[10:38] And here, it's allowing users to buy gifts
[10:42] for friends and family.
[10:44] And then what's that taking a transaction off of that?
[10:47] So now that I think about it,
[10:47] it's not that different from the first idea
[10:50] where businesses get people to buy stuff
[10:53] and a part of that sale goes to WhatsApp.
[10:55] But I like this idea because it's fun.
[10:57] And basically imagine people wanting to buy gifts for their friends.
[11:02] So that's the experience.
[11:04] Let's say my friend Janet,
[11:06] I wanted to buy her coffee because she's not feeling well.
[11:09] So I can buy, let's say Starbucks coffee for her directly on WhatsApp.
[11:13] She could go over demonen stores.
[11:15] This one's a fun idea that I heard
[11:16] exist in career, ready?
[11:18] So again, a lot of these ideas are not new.
[11:20] They are inspiration from how other apps have monetized.
[11:24] And I think that's perfectly okay.
[11:26] I mean, think about the As model that has evolved
[11:30] from being used in newspapers,
[11:31] then to TV, then to digital era of social media.
[11:35] What's important about designing monetization models, though,
[11:37] is the designing experience that won't isolate your users.
[11:41] So head tread carefully.
[11:42] And how would you decide which one to build?
[11:44] Well, similar to the product sense question,
[11:46] you would figure out what does it cost to build this
[11:49] and what is a potential revenue opportunity.
[11:52] And here's again, the four part framework,
[11:53] in tackling the question, how would you monetize WhatsApp?
[11:56] And this can be asked for any question asked you,
[12:01] how would you monetize this product?
[12:04] And this is an example of a product strategy questions,
[12:06] which tend to be harder.
[12:08] Another great question they asked during product interviews
[12:10] is how would you decide if, let's say, Amazon should enter
[12:15] the smartphone market?
[12:16] And this is quite tough.
[12:17] So check out this video where I show you the framework
[12:21] to answer these type of questions.
[12:22] And I will see you guys in the next video.
