## Transcript

[00:00] Many of you have told me that product sense questions are especially hard when A, it's about a space that you haven't directly experienced, or B, it's a space that's not aligned with the company's mission.
[00:16] So in this video, we're going to go through a mock interview of a product sense example tackling these two situations.
[00:27] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product leader at a big tech company based in Silicon Valley, California.
[00:35] So the question we're going to go through today is build a product to help people buy antiques.
[00:42] When was the last time you bought an antique? I know I have never bought an antique.
[00:49] And the framework we're going to use today is the good old product sense framework, which starts with why do we want to build this?
[00:57] Who we want to build this for? What pain points these people have and coming up with solutions.
[01:04] Now let me first clarify antiques. What are we talking about when we talk about antiques?
[01:11] So in my head, antiques could be expensive items, so the things that people would be selling at an auction sale, whether it's these like age old paintings from Monet, or these really expensive vases, you've probably seen they're a gorgeous.
[01:27] But antiques could also be cheaper items that you might find at a thrift shop or a pawn shop.
[01:33] And antiques, what are antiques? Antiques could be things as big as furniture, paintings we talked about, or smaller things such as vases or collectibles, even a coin could be counted as an antique.
[01:46] Alright, so that helps me clarify what antiques are.
[01:49] So my first question is like, why the heck do we want to build a space and is this a good space for, say, meta or Facebook's mission?
[02:00] So first, I want to cover some trends that I'm seeing as to why antiques could be the next big thing.
[02:07] The first is that we're seeing an increasing trend of people buying used goods, either for environmental purposes or people love products with a good story in history.
[02:19] Secondly, another trend we're seeing, because of COVID, people are spending a lot more time in their homes, and people have the tendency to want to decorate their homes more, or have the time to have a hobby collecting coins, or comic books, whatever that is.
[02:36] Now the mission. Now I'm asking, is the antiques space aligned with the mission of, say, meta?
[02:43] Meta's mission is to build community and connect people. So if I think about antiques, there definitely is strong communities around collectibles like certain coins or maybe vases from the Ming dynasty.
[02:58] So I could definitely see that connecting people who might have not known each other and enable a great community.
[03:05] But I would still characterize these communities as semi-niche, and hence if I'm thinking about meta-investing in groups or community, this might not be the most popular use case.
[03:17] Hence it's semi-line to the mission, but I don't know if it's the best use case if the company wants to invest in building groups and communities.
[03:26] Next, let's talk about the market size. How big of a market is the antique buying space?
[03:31] I mean, I don't have exact numbers, but if I so assume, I think it's still pretty niche. Like, yes, I mentioned it could be the next up-and-coming thing, but as of now, the people that are buying antiques could be, I don't really, really rich people, or people who maybe have a history background and no specific errors that they're like obsessed with.
[03:54] So I would characterize as a niche market versus mass market, but I could see the tam or total addressable market in the future increasing, but not by like 100 fold.
[04:05] Because people still like buying new things. Now I'm thinking, what strengths does the company have in improving this space?
[04:14] For example, when we talk about Facebook, they're products like live shopping, and we talked about the auction style, so live shopping, that feature could be great for auction style.
[04:24] At the same time, there are already a lot of strong communities inside the group's product.
[04:29] Now, I'm asking myself, how would investing in the antique buying space benefit the company?
[04:35] Here, I could see a benefit if it increases engagement amongst people.
[04:40] Again, those crazy collectors or people who are obsessed with history would probably go gaga, over certain antiques in groups.
[04:49] And hence, it might increase engagement.
[04:51] So now my final assessment does this belong within the Facebook ecosystem.
[04:56] And from this analysis, there's not a huge market size. It could, in the future, become much bigger.
[05:04] And as a line with the mission, sort of, but probably not the strongest use case.
[05:09] And hence, I'm going to recommend that we do not build this for Facebook for this question for now.
[05:15] And instead, we are a separate company, a startup, or maybe an auction house that wants to build a product to help people buy antiques.
[05:23] Next, we're going to figure out the who should we build this for.
[05:30] So fun thing about the ecosystem, there are buyers and sellers.
[05:34] On the seller side, there are institutional sellers like museums or auction houses or there are private sellers, so people like myself selling antiques, which I don't have any because I'm not rich.
[05:47] Next, you have the buyer side.
[05:50] And here, I think of three personas, starting with collectors, people who, again, are collecting certain items because they are obsessed with it.
[05:59] Second, are people that are buying to resell.
[06:03] And a third group are people who are buying antiques to enjoy themselves.
[06:08] And what differentiates these three groups in terms of problems?
[06:12] I mean, I'm not going to go into pain points just yet, but the collectors, their major problem is trying to figure out, is this real?
[06:19] Because they're really passionate about this space. They want to make sure they get the thing that is really authentic.
[06:26] For example, I don't know if you guys saw that video of Logan Paul who lost $3.5 million on fake Pokemon cards.
[06:35] Obviously, these collectors would be super sad because they invest a lot of money into these collectibles.
[06:40] The problem that people who are buying to resell with struggle with is, does the product that I'm buying have a resell value?
[06:47] So it doesn't necessarily need to be the most authentic thing, but if I buy it at a price, am I going to make a margin on it?
[06:54] And the last persona we talked about, which is people that are buying to enjoy, is this affordable?
[07:00] Does this fit within my home?
[07:02] Now, I'm going to be building for the buyer side.
[07:05] And I'm thinking about who to prioritize within the buyer side, two criteria has come up.
[07:11] First, I want to think about total dressable market.
[07:13] So which of these groups do I think are the largest?
[07:16] And second, which are these groups are the most frequent users?
[07:20] Because if I think about building a product, especially early on, I want to get people who are the early adopters,
[07:27] who are going to go crazy over my product, and then help me spread it like wildfire.
[07:32] So if I run down the list, collectors are the one that maximizes this formula or this criteria for me.
[07:39] They are a medium on total dressable market, so not the largest market, but their frequency of use is very high.
[07:47] Because they're collecting, they're going to buy multiple items just for the love and passion of it.
[07:53] Versus someone who is maybe buying for the home, they only need one piece of vase or one couch.
[08:00] Versus collectibles, they will go to town.
[08:05] I want to know, what are challenges that you face in the product design product sense question that come up over and over?
[08:12] Comment below and let me know so I can help you answer your most asked questions.
[08:18] So now what are some of the pain points for collectors?
[08:25] So I'm going to think starting with the user journey, and I'm going to imagine myself again, because I've never bought antiques.
[08:31] It's hard for me to empathize with this space, but I'm going to imagine myself as someone who needed to go hunt down a vase from the Ming Dynasty.
[08:41] How in the world am I going to find that antique and buy it and what are some of the pain points there?
[08:47] So I break it down into four separate steps, starting with discovery of the item, second, seeing results and listings, third, looking at the product description, getting details there, and fourth, actually the purchasing cycle.
[09:02] First, let's start off with discovery.
[09:04] How in the world do I find a vase from the Ming Dynasty?
[09:07] So I think about today, like if I had to go this, do this in the next hour, I, one would start with the Google search, probably find some physical places that I would call and ask, do you have this thing?
[09:19] Or it probably might lead me to some websites, or it might take me to a cragulous or eBay.
[09:25] I don't even feel very confident that I would find something, and I think most products that exist in the world that are Ming Vases, maybe aren't even posted because they live inside a museum, or someone's home
[09:36] that they're not selling. So here's some pain points that I'm imagining.
[09:40] A, this is probably a fragmented market. Again, you have the physical stores and you have the online pieces, and you have the cragulous marketplace type of classifieds.
[09:51] And then B, the other pain point is I'm imagining just low volumes of products that are posted online, so just like low supply.
[09:59] So our second phase is when we're searching, actually seeing what's available. And here, if I'm thinking it's offline in store, if I'm rummaging through, let's say, a thrift shop, there's probably a lot of manual actual searching that's not pleasant, and it's probably limited categorization.
[10:16] It's probably a bunch of things dumped to one side. But we're talking about a Ming Vase, so let's say we go to a more official place, and there I might imagine an expert would come up to me and show me some of the pieces.
[10:28] Or I might have to go and talk to the expert in terms of what I want, and they go through their own categorizations in their brain to find out what's available.
[10:37] If I'm taking the online route, there's probably searching, and I don't even know if my keyword would pop up to something like Vasewood, but would Vase from the Ming era pop up the results that I'd be interested in? questionable.
[10:52] So some of the pain points that I would imagine that exists here are a, the keywords that I type in might not match the thing that I actually want.
[11:02] And that might be because one, I'm not using the right keywords, or a lot of these antiques are actually not labeled. I mean, because they're older items, there's no item description that you barcode you could just scan from the 1800s.
[11:14] Another problem is probably these items are not being categorized or catalogued in a way that's organized for me to find those items.
[11:23] And then the other big problem is again, if I'm in physical place, you just depend on an expert to find this, or I'm manually rummaging through a bunch of stuff to find the thing that I want.
[11:36] Phase number three.
[11:37] So now let's say I do find something that looks like what I want. And I'm looking at this item and trying to figure out one, I want to learn about the description.
[11:47] So if this is online, I want to see photos of the details. And here I may imagine some challenges are the photos are not very clear, they're not focused on the detail that I want.
[11:58] I mean, as you know, for some paintings, they have a little inscription, I mean, I don't even have a painting on the corner that tells you whether it's authentic or not.
[12:07] So these little details are pretty important. Another big thing, again, four collectors that they care about is, is this item authentic? Is it a real or is it a fake?
[12:16] I mean, I'm sure I'm able to find a lot of Ming Vases on Wayfair that are local likes, but no, I want something that actually came from, when was a Ming era?
[12:25] I mean, I'll look it up and post it here. I want something from that time period. And me, I mean, I could be a collector and be an expert at these things, but there's only so much that I can tell from my eye in order to appraise the product.
[12:41] So there's a couple of challenges here. One, we talked about having few or little to zero product description. Be the photos don't show the details.
[12:52] And see, there's an authenticity problem. How do we know something is real or not? I mean, people are getting really good at creating fakes nowadays.
[13:01] And the last phase is the actual purchasing. And here, I would be asking questions like, well, what's the right price to pay for this item?
[13:10] Is it a fair price? Am I paying too much? So hence, a big pain point here is, how do I assess the value of this product?
[13:18] And especially with antiques, they're hard to price because they come from a different era. You don't know how much it costs then. You don't know the bill of materials. So a lot of the times, it's less about how much the item costs to build it, but instead, how much the market values it.
[13:34] I mean, if we're talking about a vase, it's art, right? And you know how flimsy art valuations are.
[13:40] Here, I'm going to do a quick prioritization based on one main criteria, which is pain level. Looking at my pretty exhaustive list, there are four things that I think create the highest pain. And if we solve them, could make us the company that differentiates ourselves.
[13:55] And those are first, there's low volume of supply. I mean, in general, even if people own antiques, they're not posting them, don't know where to find them. Again, this is an assumption.
[14:05] So I'm going to assume low volume of things like vases from the main era. Second, high pain point is that keywords don't match what I'm searching for. And this is if we're talking about online searches, if it's physical searches, that's even harder. So we can won't even go there.
[14:21] Third, another big pain point is that there's no product descriptions for these antique items. So how might some know what it is, what it's about, where it's from.
[14:30] And those are things I would want to know as a collector, right? I care about the history of products. But same time, like who's going to write those product descriptions.
[14:37] Unless it was a really expensive item. And the fourth biggest pain point I feel is how do you tell the authenticity of a product?
[14:46] One, I'd be scared as a seller, legitimate or not. Am I going to be able to refund my item? How do I figure out whether this product is actually really from the main era or from the song era?
[14:57] Because if I'm a collectible, I'm obsessed with the small details. Because if one of my friends find out that this vase was from the song Dynasty, that would be so embarrassing.
[15:09] So here, I'm asking myself before I go into the solutions, what is my strategy to win in this space? I want to build a product that is going to beat out all the other competitors selling antiques.
[15:22] So my three pronged strategy or my focuses is number one is to drive more supply into the ecosystem and find creative ways to do that.
[15:31] The second is to help people effortlessly find but also discover items that they might not be looking for, but they might be interested in.
[15:39] And third is to create a system of trust within our product so that scams tend to happen less.
[15:51] Now let's go into solutions. And here, I'm going to go into solutions for the four high pain points that we talked about.
[15:59] Instead of focusing on just one pain point. So then I have a volume of ideas. And here my solutions are going to entail of product slash features, operational things we can do, and marketing related things that we can do.
[16:12] So first problem was just low supply. And here we can maybe partner with smaller and teach shops slash boutiques in order to get all of their inventory online and to use us as a marketplace to sell online and offline.
[16:28] That way they don't have to create their own separate website. And we might incentivize them to upload their items online because we know it's a lot of work.
[16:36] Either hiring someone for them that can do it over a couple days a week a month or maybe even reducing their commissions fee. We could figure that out.
[16:45] Another way we can get more items online is maybe create a product appraisal tool. So this is something where people can snap a photo of one of the antique items and get an idea of how much they can sell it for.
[16:57] And here maybe people are hesitant about uploading their products online because they don't know how much it's worth or don't know if it's worth the effort.
[17:05] But if you give them a tool to sense like, oh wow, this thing is actually really worthy and you can sell it for a lot. That might be incentive for them to sell it.
[17:14] Another solution for getting more supply online is to partner with collectors, partner with individual collectors and tap into that community.
[17:22] And maybe within groups of collectors for certain items, getting them excited to upload the products onto our platform.
[17:31] And this might be posting, insert in groups or classifies where collectors are, certain communities. Maybe there's Reddit, subgroups where collectors are.
[17:41] Next we want to solve for the keyword matches that don't line up with what we're searching for.
[17:47] Some solutions here could be creating keywords upon upload. So this would use some ML technology and basically and some visual recognition where let's say you hover over the item, you take a photo of it and it would start labeling different components.
[18:04] So my main Vaz that I've been talking about, they would label it first of Vaz because that is more obvious and then it would have to go do some research on from what era that Vaz looks most closely like.
[18:14] Another solution here could be just crowdsourcing from the community what this item is. And here collectors love to lean into the community and help the community out.
[18:24] And maybe we might even incentivize them by giving them points that they can then translate in the credit to buy and teach.
[18:31] Next the problem is the photos aren't great or the item doesn't come with a product description.
[18:36] And here you might encourage sellers to upload videos, 360 degree videos of the product instead of just individual photos. So they make sure that everything is captured.
[18:48] Another solution you might hire expert photographers who know what detail the capture in the photo for antiques or a more scalable solution is really to just create a video to teach people who are selling how to take those photos.
[19:03] Lastly the problem of the seller authenticity. While the first solution here could be we hold certain money that the buyer pays for in an escrow basically a fund that we as the marketplace manage and only give out to the seller after 30 days.
[19:20] Like if the buyer within 30 days doesn't complain or doesn't want to return the item we then the seller gets that money.
[19:26] Another way is to maybe consider address verification. And this ensures that if the seller is committing fraud you have an address that you can send the police to.
[19:36] Another solution for seller or item authenticity is to get the sellers actually ship it to let's say our marketplace is warehouse where we appraise and see whether this item is fake or not.
[19:48] Obviously that would be more work on our side but let's say the seller would pay us for that or the buyer might pay us an extra fee for that.
[19:56] And the last solution is creating a return policy that's semi-generous basically within 30 days if the buyer is not satisfied whether it's because it's authentic or just some other parts of it they can return it.
[20:09] And that could make the seller feel more responsible that they have to sell something or that it's in their best interest to sell something that is rip.
[20:17] We just walked through the question what product would you build in order to help people buy antiques.
[20:24] And here's some things that stands out about this response. It is not perfect of course but some of the things that I was intentional about the IC best candidates do.
[20:35] The first thing is truthfully assessing does this fit within the Facebook product of ecosystems and not just force fitting it into it just because the question is from an interviewer from that company.
[20:48] The second thing that I intentionally did was prioritizing clearly and objectively.
[20:52] Third, I was also intentional about sharing clear strategy how we were going to win, how we were going to differentiate ourselves from the market or be stronger than those in the market.
[21:02] Number four, I actually tackled multiple pain points in my solutions rather than just going with one pain point.
[21:09] And this is optional. You can either choose one pain point or choose a couple but I like the couple pain points because it shows a multitude of creative solutions rather than trapping me into one pain point where I might feel a bit more stuck coming up with solutions.
[21:23] And then my solutions actually solve the problem like that people take for granted but is important.
[21:30] So if you want more examples of product sense questions and how we go through them take a look at these two examples here where we go through more product sense questions because in this case prepping for product sense product design interviews repetition really really helps.
[21:47] And challenging yourself to think in like odd unrelatable spaces this challenge actually makes you stronger in product sense questions.
[21:57] And I will see you guys in the next video.
