## Transcript

[00:00] One of the most common parts of product interviews today are take home projects.
[00:05] In this video, I'm going to show you an example and a structure you can use to tackle take home projects.
[00:13] So you're not spending weeks because you probably have a full time job and you don't have time for homework.
[00:19] So let's get into it.
[00:23] The part number one is understanding the business.
[00:26] How are you supposed to propose solutions or a strategy if you don't understand the business?
[00:31] And this is a piece that most people skip over or miss, but it's really critical.
[00:35] The understanding the business means understanding what is the mission of the company.
[00:39] And a lot of the times the mission will be pretty generic,
[00:42] but you'll want to highlight the key themes that it stands for so that you can connect your strategy to later.
[00:50] So here's an example of squares mission, which we're going to use as an example for the rest of this video.
[00:55] Next, you'll understand the goals of the company.
[00:58] So these might be three to five metrics.
[01:01] What is the North Star metric?
[01:03] Of course, in all of these goals, revenue is going to lie somewhere at business.
[01:07] That's to make money, but there might be other goals like the number of subscribers,
[01:11] the watch time, if it's something like YouTube with Square.
[01:14] It's probably something like the number of businesses signed up and a total subscription revenue.
[01:20] Then you'll want to look to understand who are the users of this company's products.
[01:25] It's usually a multi-sided ecosystem.
[01:27] And hence you want to cover who are the different players.
[01:30] And lastly, you'll want to understand the business model.
[01:33] How does the business make dollars?
[01:36] I mean, money.
[01:37] And how does the goal ladder up to the way it makes money?
[01:40] So the easiest way to get these things if the company is public is to search their earnings report.
[01:46] So here's an example of some of the information from Square's latest earnings report.
[01:51] Again, this part is very important because it helps you understand the business and services,
[01:56] the foundations that you can build your product recommendations off of.
[02:00] The second part is to deal with data.
[02:02] And this section is probably the trickiest, but also the most pivotal.
[02:06] Because how are you supposed to come up with a strategy or know what to build if you don't know information
[02:12] or insights about what the problem is?
[02:14] But at the same time with these take-home exams, because they're so ambiguous,
[02:19] it's very easy to fall into a rabbit hole of digging for data
[02:23] and it is really mentally draining trust me.
[02:25] So ideally, you'll want to find some data,
[02:28] but not dig so hard where you're going past page five on Google search.
[02:32] So what are some of the categories of data you want to look for?
[02:35] It starts with the user research.
[02:37] And the first thing you can do is actually do some user interviews
[02:41] and nothing beats talking to customers.
[02:44] And this was something that I learned at Stripe,
[02:46] where you want to be a culture where you can pick up the phone, email,
[02:50] VC, whatever, and talk directly to customers.
[02:53] So it was actually interviewing for a B2B product.
[02:55] And I remember they told me explicitly,
[02:58] we want you to go interview our customers.
[03:00] And I had another client who was interviewing with Uber,
[03:02] who actually interviewed Uber drivers and Uber riders.
[03:06] So this could be a great way to get some interesting insights
[03:09] that the company might not have even realized.
[03:11] Another way to get some user research is to look at app reviews.
[03:15] So on the Google Play Store or the Apple Store,
[03:17] you'll find people writing reviews about the product experience.
[03:21] Again, they're not the highest of quality,
[03:23] but you might be able to pick out some themes that you see reoccurring.
[03:27] And the last place to get some user interviews
[03:29] could be directly from forums.
[03:31] So people are talking about the good and the bad of products
[03:34] in things like on things like Reddit or even YouTube videos
[03:38] where people are reviewing products.
[03:40] The next category of data you want to get is market research.
[03:43] So this is broken down in things like getting stats
[03:46] and looking at sources like Satista or Pew Research
[03:49] or sometimes when you just Google stats for,
[03:52] say the restaurant industry, things come up.
[03:54] You can also get industry reports.
[03:56] You would Google stats for X industry.
[03:59] Sometimes you have companies that are providing that space,
[04:02] providing these industry reports
[04:03] because they have customers who want to learn more
[04:05] or you have VCs sharing these industry reports
[04:08] or consulting companies like McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group,
[04:12] Vayne and Company, et cetera.
[04:13] So those are usually the more reliable sources
[04:15] that you want to look at.
[04:16] And then if you can find, look at some raw data.
[04:19] And here you might be able to find some of that data
[04:21] in the public earning versus the report directly.
[04:24] So for example, Google shares a lot of information
[04:27] on the number of, let's say, average revenue per subscriber.
[04:31] So now that you have all this data,
[04:32] what are you going to want to do with it?
[04:34] And this is the fun part, which is,
[04:36] you're going to want to look for themes
[04:38] that keep coming up over and over again.
[04:40] Let's say three to five themes.
[04:42] Here in your presentation,
[04:43] you either want to screenshot it or take direct quotes,
[04:46] the show that it's coming from the mouth of users.
[04:49] And then from these themes,
[04:50] you'll then want to prioritize.
[04:51] And as with prioritizing, you always lead with a criteria.
[04:54] And here are some parts of the criteria
[04:56] that might be checking which of these themes are actually gaps
[04:59] in the company because you might prioritize something
[05:01] but then not realize the company's actually working heavily
[05:04] into the space.
[05:05] Another criteria is what is the impact
[05:06] on investing in this theme on the key goals?
[05:10] Sure, a lot of people could complain about a product
[05:12] on a certain domain.
[05:14] But if the company doesn't care about that space
[05:16] and it is not a way for the company to make money,
[05:19] it's not going to matter.
[05:20] And another criteria might be,
[05:21] is this going to serve as a competitive advantage
[05:23] for the company?
[05:24] Or are competitors already working on this
[05:26] and not making a drop in the bucket
[05:28] isn't going to make a difference?
[05:29] So a lot of my clients who I help on take home projects
[05:34] struggle with the thought of,
[05:35] I get so stuck on getting data
[05:39] or being overwhelmed by so much data.
[05:41] So note here, they don't care so much about the right answer
[05:45] as much as your process.
[05:46] So if there was data that is maybe wrong,
[05:50] it matters less than how you built upon that data.
[05:54] If you're building logical conclusions throughout,
[05:57] that at least shows that you can do and execute
[06:00] if you were given the right data.
[06:02] Step number three is now getting into the strategy.
[06:06] The first, you now have themes that you've prioritized.
[06:09] And hence, you want to show a strategy
[06:11] that tackles those themes
[06:13] and discuss how it ladders up to the higher mission.
[06:16] So this is where you're going to bring back the understand work
[06:19] that was done above in understanding the business,
[06:22] how it makes money, et cetera.
[06:24] And the word strategy is a word thrown around all the time
[06:28] people don't really know what it means.
[06:30] Plane and simple, it means a plan of attack,
[06:33] a plan and how to win.
[06:36] And once you have, let's say you're three-pronged strategy,
[06:38] you want to come up with some solutions to tackle each part
[06:42] of that strategy.
[06:43] So maybe think of two to three ideas per strategy.
[06:46] You'll want to mix of practical solutions
[06:49] and moonshot ideas to show the company
[06:51] that you can think practically
[06:53] but also think more innovatively.
[06:55] Especially in companies like Google,
[06:57] they really look for moonshot ideas
[06:59] versus companies like Facebook.
[07:00] They look to solve the practical people problem
[07:02] is what we called it.
[07:03] Then you'll want to do some prioritization
[07:05] off of those solutions and do an ROI analysis.
[07:08] An ROI return investment is basically looking at
[07:10] what is the effort you would need to put in
[07:12] to execute on this and what is the benefit
[07:15] on some key goals that you would get.
[07:18] And you'd be choosing the solutions
[07:19] that have the largest return on investment
[07:22] and prioritizing those first.
[07:24] Now you have some ideas and prioritize solutions.
[07:27] You'll want to come up with some wireframes
[07:29] and these are rough sketches on the user flow,
[07:32] on the user experience,
[07:33] to show that you know how to design a product.
[07:36] You'll then want to turn the strategy into a roadmap.
[07:39] And this is a month by month execution plan
[07:44] to show in sequence what are you deciding to work on for us
[07:47] and how you prioritizing it.
[07:49] A company wants to know not only can you come up
[07:53] with a strategy but you know how to get things done
[07:56] which ladders into execution.
[07:58] So in the execution section,
[08:00] you'll want to talk about success metrics.
[08:03] How do you know whether your plan is winning or not?
[08:06] And I'm going to link a video above
[08:07] which talks about how to come up with success metrics.
[08:10] You'll also want to propose experiments,
[08:12] basic AB tests on hypotheses you might have
[08:15] on how the product should be rolled out or designed.
[08:18] And you'll also want to talk about the go-to market strategy
[08:22] which is now let's say you have the product,
[08:24] how do you get it into people's awareness and consciousness,
[08:28] how do you get people to actually purchase the product?
[08:31] What is the brand that people associate the product with?
[08:34] And this is such a key component on launching successful product.
[08:39] So if you're not sure how to tackle this
[08:41] so you'll want to watch this video
[08:43] I'll be talking about go-to market strategies
[08:45] and I will see you guys in the next video.
