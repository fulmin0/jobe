[00:00] If you get a product sense or design questions like design a product to help people find doctors for your product manager interview
[00:09] A key thing that the interviewer will be assessing is your ability to show user empathy through user pain points.
[00:18] Deeply understanding user pain points is essential for brainstorming really creative solutions.
[00:25] So today I'm going to share a process that will help you come up with outstanding pain points.
[00:34] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a big tech company in Silicon Valley, California.
[00:41] And I bring you the best tips to get into product management and teach you how to succeed once you've made it.
[00:48] So we're going to go through a three-part process.
[00:50] So the first is to create a user journey which will help you understand the existing experience.
[00:58] The second is to start identifying pain points.
[01:03] And here's where you can flag areas that are sub-optimal or frustrating that can inspire really interesting solutions.
[01:11] And third, prioritize pain points.
[01:15] Lead with a criteria to help you convey to the interviewer how are you deciding which pain point to prioritize.
[01:23] So let's get into it.
[01:25] We're going to use the example question I shared up top.
[01:29] Design a product to help people find doctors.
[01:33] And the user segment I'm going to be using is people who need to find specialty doctors.
[01:39] Think about dermatologists, oncologists, hematologists, cyanologists.
[01:44] Yeah, these are not where I'm making up the actual medical terms that I discovered.
[01:49] So let's jump into the first step, which is creating your user journey.
[01:53] You want to start here by brainstorming your most recent experience and make sure it's a concrete experience.
[02:01] Ask yourself questions like what was the first step that I took?
[02:05] What was the next step?
[02:07] And keep going until you get to the last step that it took to accomplish the task in this case of finding a doctor.
[02:14] A key tip here is to make sure you don't ignore existing solutions and to add it into the current experience.
[02:23] And another key tip here is to break down and get as specific as you can.
[02:29] Because the more specific you get, the more you can empathize with the user.
[02:34] And the more opportunities you'll get to find really interesting pain points.
[02:39] All right, enough explaining.
[02:41] Let me show you how I use these tips in the example question we talked about.
[02:46] So I'm going to start off thinking about my most recent experience.
[02:50] And I was actually a couple months ago.
[02:52] I had to find a hematologist because I had some irregular blood results going to my physician.
[02:58] So thinking back, the first step was identifying that I needed a specialty doctor.
[03:05] And in that case, it came from a recommendation from my physician who noticed that I had irregular results from my regular blood test.
[03:14] But I remember in the past, I had definitely asked my physician to give me a referral to a dermatologist.
[03:23] So those are two ways how I landed on needing a specialty doctor.
[03:28] Now I'm asking myself, what did I do after that?
[03:31] So the second was finding the actual doctors.
[03:35] And again, thinking back, that last time with the hematologist, the referral actually came from my doctor.
[03:42] Most of the specialists came as referrals from my doctors.
[03:46] But there were other times where I wanted to find my own doctor.
[03:50] So I would go on ZockDock or do some quick Googling.
[03:55] And you'd be surprised finding a hematologist in San Francisco was not easy.
[04:00] A third step in deciding the doctor, I had to make sure that doctor filled my requirements.
[04:06] For example, I had to check that their insurance, that they supported, covered the insurance that I had,
[04:12] that they were nearby to where I lived and so it was convenient,
[04:17] that the doctor actually had some available appointments in the next month.
[04:22] And this required me to call the doctor's office directly to find out some of those things.
[04:28] And the last step was actually requesting the appointment.
[04:32] And in most cases, I had to call the doctor's office.
[04:36] Or I used ZockDock.
[04:38] That was me mapping out the experience and spending some time to understand.
[04:43] And that alone already started prepping me for identifying experiences that were suboptimal or annoying or frustrating to help you in the next step.
[04:53] So let's jump into the second step of this framework, which is identifying the pain points.
[04:59] If you did a good job in the last step in being specific and breaking down each step as much as possible,
[05:07] you'll probably already see a couple of pain points leaped out at you.
[05:11] So the key questions you want to ask yourself here are,
[05:15] which experiences from what I just mapped out was a,
[05:20] frustrating or annoying or maddening any of those emotions, and be just suboptimal and inefficient.
[05:29] The part about identifying experiences that were frustrating is exactly how you empathize with the user.
[05:37] And that part is especially powerful because I can remember when I felt emotionally charged at some frustrating experiences.
[05:45] And that emotions is always the best inspiration or motivator to try to solve something.
[05:53] Let's look through the steps that I identified in the last step.
[05:57] And you can hear me now complain about some suboptimal and frustrating experiences.
[06:02] So remember the first step I had to identify that I needed a specialty doctor.
[06:07] And in this case, it was plain annoying that I had to go to my physician first to request a referral to a doctor.
[06:14] Instead of being able to go directly to, let's say, a dermatologist, the second step was finding some doctors.
[06:21] And here, what can be frustrating most times is a doctor only gives you one referral to one specific doctor.
[06:29] And most times, I'm thinking, my head, they probably have some sort of kickback.
[06:33] And I don't know how much I trust that referral.
[06:36] So not having choices could be suboptimal for me.
[06:41] When that was the case, I went to look on ZockDock and sometimes ZockDock doesn't have that many listings.
[06:48] So again, not having choices on one platform was also frustrating because that then pushed me to Google.
[06:56] And I found a couple more doctors.
[06:59] But the information on Google was very lacking.
[07:03] Google didn't give me what insurance these doctors covered.
[07:06] They didn't give me what appointment slots that they had.
[07:09] So here, the frustrating experience was not having complete or enough information to make a decision.
[07:16] So to summarize the three pain points, there were limited options.
[07:20] So lack of supply to having to go to multiple platforms to find the supply of doctors.
[07:27] And three, not having the information that I needed to make the actual decision.
[07:33] So remember, we talked about the third step was deciding which doctor.
[07:37] When I think about deciding which doctor, knowing that they support the insurance that I have is priority number one.
[07:45] Because I hate paying out a pocket.
[07:47] Other things I needed to know is their proximity to where I live.
[07:51] I'm not going to go to another state to visit a doctor.
[07:54] And another frustrating thing can be not knowing how much something has been a cost.
[07:58] Have you ever been to the doctor?
[08:00] And for some reason they refuse to tell you how much something costs.
[08:03] Because they themselves don't know what exams might be required.
[08:06] A couple weeks later, you get a bill for, let's say, $5,000.
[08:11] The pain point here is a lack of information to help me make my best decision on what doctor I choose.
[08:19] And the fourth step in that journey was actually requesting that appointment.
[08:25] I mentioned most times I had to call the doctor's office to find an appointment time that worked.
[08:32] Even with soft-doc, with available times, sometimes it would still have me call the doctor's office.
[08:39] So that's really frustrating.
[08:41] Because how many of you remember calling the doctor's office, being asked to put on hold.
[08:46] And when someone finally comes back to the phone, there's this back and forth exchange with what time the doctors are available and it not working for you.
[08:56] And then when you need to change the appointment time, like God forbid, you have to call the doctor's office back again.
[09:03] And by that time, their appointment times are filled up.
[09:06] So most likely you have to wait another month for your appointment.
[09:11] Oh, just thinking about it, I am a steaming.
[09:15] And that's how you want to feel when you come up with pain points.
[09:18] This just frustration with your personal experience that can be generalized to a lot of other people's experiences.
[09:27] The third step, now that you come up with a couple of pain points, you want to prioritize them to develop your MVP.
[09:36] There are so many pain points that I talked about with we have limited resources as a company and we probably can't tackle all of them at one time.
[09:44] So what are the critical pain points you're going to prioritize?
[09:50] And here you'll want to show the interviewer that you can make a data driven and logical decision.
[09:56] Starting with the criteria, what are the things that you're trying to optimize for and how would you weigh each of them?
[10:06] Then quickly score each of the options relative to each other based on your criteria.
[10:14] Some of the criteria that you can use is A.
[10:18] How many people are experiencing this pain point?
[10:21] We want to build something that has impact on as many people as possible.
[10:26] The second thing, how painful is this?
[10:29] The more painful something is, the more motivated people will act to solve it.
[10:35] And the third, how many solutions already exist?
[10:39] How many pain points, but if it's already well solved by a company or an organization, there might not be that much space for you to play here.
[10:48] Now you have the pain points and now you have the criteria.
[10:52] Here's a fun part which is scoring these pain points along the dimensions of the criteria and finding one that gets the highest score.
[11:02] I'm going to show you how this works by using our pain points from the last step and scoring them along the criteria that we just talked about.
[11:12] And you'll see in this example, I only chose two criteria because the more criteria I put in there, the longer it's going to take me.
[11:19] And again, the interview is only 45 minutes long and the pain point part should only be, let's say, five minutes long.
[11:27] You'll see I have the pain points on one side and the criteria along the top side.
[11:33] I'm going to start putting in the scores for each of them.
[11:36] Again, relative to each other, remember that.
[11:40] Because otherwise you might struggle to say, is this a four or is this a five?
[11:43] Ask yourself, if that's a four, then is this less or more?
[11:48] And that can help you come up with a score more easily.
[11:51] And then at the end, you want to find the pain point that has the highest score by multiplying the numbers for each criteria.
[12:01] The highest number could be the one you solve for.
[12:04] And that's how you prioritize a pain point.
[12:07] Another key insight here is you can prioritize multiple pain points.
[12:12] If you're building an MVP, it's going to be hard to build a product that allows you to search if there's no directory.
[12:19] So if you're going with one pain point, feel free to go deeper in understanding that pain point, which can serve as inspiration for coming up with great solutions.
[12:30] A common mistake interviews will make is picking their pain point first and then rationalizing why they chose it.
[12:38] Or even worse, not even explaining why they chose it and moving on.
[12:43] As I mentioned in my past videos, what's most important in these interviews isn't just to get the right answer, but is to explain and convey and convince your interviewer that the answer you chose is something that they can get on board with.
[12:59] Guys, I hope that was helpful in answering the question, how you come up with pain points and show user empathy in the product sense and the product design question.
