[00:00] The most common product interview question is what is your favorite product and why and how would you improve it?
[00:09] So in this video, we're gonna show you a framework to tackle this question so you can ace this question and get the job.
[00:16] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product leader in Big Tech.
[00:20] So I'm gonna share with you guys my actual favorite product that I only discovered a couple months ago.
[00:26] It's called Too Good To Go.
[00:28] And simply put, it's a food app that basically sells you surplus food from restaurants at a very steep discount.
[00:38] And this product I love because it's a social impact product at its foundation because it's tackling the problem of food waste.
[00:46] And how does it work?
[00:47] Basically, me as a customer, I'll go into Too Good To Go and start my first journey by searching for restaurants based on fizzlers like near me,
[00:56] based on when it's available to pick up the order.
[01:00] Then next, I'll go to the company's profile page and take a look on what types of food they're selling, the ratings.
[01:08] And at the bottom, I can choose to claim a surprise bag.
[01:12] What is a surprise bag?
[01:13] A surprise bag basically means, you'll get whatever surplus food that the restaurant has and you don't really know what it is.
[01:20] And some of you might be thinking, oh, am I getting rotten food, am I getting fish bones?
[01:25] I've been on this app since April at all of the meals that I've gotten were fresh, cooked that day, and not bad leftovers.
[01:34] And once I've claimed my surprise bag, I will go to the restaurant to pick it up within a certain window of time.
[01:41] So now that I've talked to you about what it does and with that, let me dive into our framework to tackle this question.
[01:47] So the first part of the framework is the motivation.
[01:50] Basically, what problem is this product solving?
[01:53] And I mentioned the first problem this product is solving is tackling food waste.
[01:58] I did a quick Google and in the US alone, 30 to 40% of our food is wasted.
[02:05] That is astonishing.
[02:07] And this was reported by the USDA's economic research team.
[02:10] So you can imagine how much food wastage there is.
[02:14] Another problem that this app is tackling is food affordability, especially in recent times where inflation,
[02:20] especially for food, has just soared in the US, food affordability is a problem.
[02:27] And hence, this app allows you to buy the surplus from restaurants that would thrown it away anyways
[02:33] for anywhere from $3 to $7.
[02:36] Second, we're going to talk about the users and the value that they get from too good to go.
[02:41] So for this product, you have the businesses and the consumers on one side.
[02:45] First, the businesses find value because they're able to resell the surplus food that they would have thrown away and lost money on.
[02:55] And it also helps them set a brand of being environmentally conscious.
[03:00] On the consumer side, the value they get is access to more affordable food.
[03:05] Because these restaurants that are signed up on too good to go are everywhere.
[03:09] So I live in New York City and literally restaurants that I would normally go to that are quite nice.
[03:15] Are offering these surplus food bags.
[03:17] So it's allowing consumers to access more affordable food while also helping the planet.
[03:24] And what does the company to go to go get from this?
[03:27] Well, I haven't looked into their business model, but I think that the businesses pay to go to go to be on the platform.
[03:34] And it might be some really affordable rate.
[03:36] And businesses are willing to pay that because they're going to make money off of selling on too good to go.
[03:41] Our third part is diving into the meat of it.
[03:44] So why is it my favorite product?
[03:46] Well, let me tell you.
[03:48] And before I do, let me share from the interviewer's point of view what they are trying to assess in your answer.
[03:55] They want to see two things.
[03:57] First, strategic thinking.
[03:59] That you have a strategic point of view on why this product is good.
[04:04] And when I talk about strategy, what does that mean?
[04:06] Strategic thinking is that you understand the business model.
[04:09] You understand how supplying the man dynamics work.
[04:12] You can talk about strategic engagement and retention tactics.
[04:16] And then you can connect things to the businesses' goals.
[04:20] A second thing they're evaluating is that you have product sense.
[04:23] That you understand what is good design that helps the company drive up their business goals.
[04:29] So let's talk through some of that.
[04:30] Three reasons why this is one of my favorite products.
[04:33] The first is that it's a sustainable social good business model.
[04:38] So I mentioned businesses are incentivized to sell their food surplus
[04:44] because they make extra money off of something they would have thrown out.
[04:49] And you might be thinking, well, doesn't this cannibalize your food business?
[04:52] No. Why?
[04:54] Because they are basically selling these food at odd hours that might not be the most convenient for customers.
[05:02] So for example, I've had to pick up too good to go bags at 9 p.m.
[05:07] or at middle of the day 4 p.m.
[05:09] So that's how they protect businesses from cannibalizing what customers would have paid
[05:14] for say a dinner.
[05:16] So for businesses, these two revenue streams are separate.
[05:20] On the consumer front, it's sustainable because the food is affordable.
[05:24] So customers will continue buying.
[05:26] There's also a plathura of restaurants if you're in New York like I am.
[05:31] So hence a lot of choices based on where people are.
[05:35] And this is again good for businesses because this is almost like a trial for customers.
[05:40] They get access to cheaper surplus food.
[05:43] They taste that they like it.
[05:44] And they go back to the restaurant for to pay for full meal.
[05:48] And this model seems to be working pretty well given how many restaurants are on the to go
[05:55] to go platform lining up the streets of Manhattan and the other burrows.
[05:59] So every time I feel like eating out, I will go check to go to go because it helps me reduce
[06:05] food waste and contribute towards a positive mission and at the same time get access to affordable
[06:10] food. The second reason why I love to go to go.
[06:13] They make searching and discovering food easy.
[06:17] Usually when I'm looking to buy food, it is a process I tell you.
[06:21] I'm on Google Maps looking at rating them review and it takes forever to the point where
[06:25] I have analysis paralysis that I just give up and cook at home.
[06:29] But too good to go has simplified it and given me enough
[06:33] information to make a decision.
[06:35] So things that they've combined to help me make the decision.
[06:38] The first is showing me a visual map of food places.
[06:43] So that gives me an idea of location based on where I am.
[06:47] And it allows me to add filters based on the time of pickup or whether it's a grocery store or
[06:53] a restaurant.
[06:54] And they also have ratings but not reviews.
[06:57] So again that simplifies it a bit because I can just quickly look at ratings rather than having
[07:02] a read lengthy reviews.
[07:04] And another part on your homepage, they show shortcuts such as recommendations for you.
[07:10] I don't find this to be the most useful and they can definitely do better on their algorithm there.
[07:15] Because a lot of the places they show me are quite far away.
[07:18] And lastly they have notifications telling me about new restaurants that I might be interested in.
[07:24] Again I'm not sure what the algorithm that goes into predicting that because some of the
[07:28] recommendations that come up are not very relevant.
[07:32] The third reason why I love this product is because it makes me feel good when I use it.
[07:38] How often can you say that about a product?
[07:41] Most products you use you'll feel like, oh I'm spending way too much time and wasting time here
[07:46] or other products I'm spending way too much money on this and I shouldn't.
[07:50] Most products usually touch a vice.
[07:53] Unless you're talking about fitness apps.
[07:55] But too good to go every time I order.
[07:58] They give me a confirmation page telling me that I contributed to tackling food waste by buying
[08:04] one of their surprise bags.
[08:06] And in my profile they show me how much CO2E that I've helped save and also how much money that
[08:11] I helped saved.
[08:13] This makes me feel like I'm contributing towards a larger mission and hence it keeps me loyal to
[08:19] the brand.
[08:19] So I mention every time I feel like eating out I will check too good to go.
[08:23] And it's also a great way to meal prep.
[08:25] There's buy a bunch of stuff in the beginning of the week and you can eat it throughout the week.
[08:29] Our fourth part is tackling the how would you improve this by talking about pain points and
[08:36] solutions.
[08:37] So let me share what the interviewers try and assess here.
[08:40] They are trying to gauge that you have empathy that you can understand what is painful
[08:45] for the users that you identified and things that are still going unsolved.
[08:49] Because one of the key skills for product managers in building great products is user empathy.
[08:55] Another thing to try to gauge is that you can think of problem-led solutions instead of
[09:01] solutions looking for a problem.
[09:03] Because we know a lot of people fall into that trap.
[09:06] And the last is prioritization.
[09:08] Can you from a whole host, a whole list of things that sound interesting prioritize the
[09:14] one that's going to be the most important for your business's goals?
[09:19] So how would I improve this product?
[09:21] Two things that I identified.
[09:23] The first pain point that users have is what am I even getting?
[09:28] I remember the first few times that I ordered.
[09:31] I had no idea what to expect.
[09:33] Whether what I was going to get was a value.
[09:35] I mentioned these surprise bags don't come with any information on what's in them.
[09:41] Because some businesses don't even know until they package it.
[09:44] Because they're basically picking the things that they have a surplus of.
[09:48] And they won't know what that is until they look at what's available.
[09:52] So this ambiguity might make people not want to take the risk of ordering food,
[09:58] especially for early customers.
[10:00] And this has a huge impact on probably one of the main metrics for good to go,
[10:06] which is the number of orders.
[10:08] The number of times people click that claim surprise bag button.
[10:12] So what could be some solutions to solve this problem?
[10:16] Well, I'll start with the easiest one first.
[10:18] Well, businesses can maybe import their menus to give people an idea what to expect.
[10:24] Businesses know best what they're offering so they can just write.
[10:27] These are the general things that I'm selling at my restaurant.
[10:29] So what you're getting could be a whole host of some of these things.
[10:33] A second easiest solution that we can make more complex is that people who have
[10:38] bought and before can share their photos of what they received.
[10:42] So others can see what the food looks like.
[10:46] And they can see whether it's fresh or not.
[10:48] I like the solution because it also keeps businesses accountable
[10:52] that they need to be giving customers not rot in food.
[10:55] And if we were to make the solution more complex,
[10:58] we could layer AI on top and get a system that sees and labels the food from the photos
[11:05] and then write that into text to tell customers what the restaurant is offering.
[11:09] But also allow people to search for key words of what they want to eat
[11:14] and show restaurants that are offering those things.
[11:16] The next solution could be breaking out the ratings into more granular pieces.
[11:22] So today on Too Good To Go, there's a rating system where you can choose from one star to five star.
[11:28] But a general overall rating is kind of ambiguous what people are rating it based on.
[11:33] So maybe breaking it out into other factors like what would people rate this restaurant on
[11:38] freshness or the amount of food given.
[11:42] And that way people have more confidence in what to expect.
[11:46] And especially those that are worried about food safety can check the rating on freshness.
[11:52] The second big pain point is actually getting the food.
[11:57] I mentioned the food is really offered at really odd hours.
[12:01] So usually when a restaurant closes or around 9 pm or for bakeries in the middle of the day
[12:06] when the cafe closes.
[12:07] So hence this makes it really inconvenient for customers to get the food.
[12:12] And this could lead to less orders which is the main metric that Too Good To Go cares about.
[12:17] So some solutions, maybe the first one the restaurants can offer early pricing.
[12:22] It means the food that they're selling to is a bit more expensive but still discounted.
[12:26] But offer it at a more convenient time.
[12:29] And this could be for restaurants who let's say they close at 9 and they offer the food at 8
[12:35] and they know at 8 o'clock they have so much surplus food that they're okay
[12:40] selling the food at an earlier time because they know between 8 or 9 they're not going to get a
[12:45] ton more customers to eat all of the food.
[12:47] The second solution could be either building out or partnering with a delivery
[12:52] partner.
[12:52] And here because the food price isn't too expensive people might be willing to
[12:57] shell out money to have the food delivered.
[12:59] And because it's off busy hours the cost for delivery should be cheaper.
[13:03] And this could be a good way for Too Good To Go to earn more revenue.
[13:07] So if I was to prioritize based on my key business goal which is the number of orders
[13:13] what pain point would I prioritize?
[13:15] If I think about it not knowing what I'm getting that might be an initial pain point
[13:19] if I'm an early customer but if I had more and more experiences and developed trust for the
[13:24] platform it shouldn't really impact the number of orders.
[13:27] Of course if you can't get a person past the first order then they're not going to order
[13:31] consecutive orders so it's still a pain but as Too Good To Go becomes more popular people might
[13:38] be more willing to trust it if they know a friend had a good experience or if they see that the
[13:43] app is download a gazillion times.
[13:46] But what continues to be a sticking problem that will limit the number of orders is people getting
[13:51] the food at these inconvenient times.
[13:54] So for example I am a pretty loyal customer but if I have to go pick up food at 9 pm
[13:59] by that time I've already eaten or I'm too lazy to go.
[14:02] So by helping people get the food in easier ways Too Good To Go can increase their orders
[14:09] tremendously and hence businesses can increase their revenue from selling Too Good To Go surprise
[14:17] and between the two options of solutions we have either early pricing or the delivery partner.
[14:22] If I like the delivery partner one has way too much logistics and possible costs
[14:27] even if the company could earn revenue.
[14:29] So hence I might in my MEP test out the early pricing model by making the food a bit more
[14:35] expensive so companies can earn more profit which is good for them but customers can also get
[14:40] the food at more convenient times so it's a better win-win for all versus delivery option
[14:46] you're still getting the delivery at 9 pm after you finish your dinner.
[14:50] So let's review the four key steps we went through.
[14:52] The first is the motivation.
[14:54] What problem is this company tackling?
[14:57] The second is figuring out who the users and what does the value they're getting from the product.
[15:03] Third answers the question why is this a favorite product of mine?
[15:07] And you want to talk about strategic and design reasons.
[15:10] And last thing number four answers how would you improve this product
[15:14] by looking at pain points and solutions and prioritizing?
[15:19] So this one example isn't enough to help you digest how to answer this question.
[15:23] Here is another answer to the what is my favorite product and how would I improve it question
[15:28] on Yelp.
[15:29] So if you love the Yelp product too you'll want to watch this.
[15:33] And I will see you guys in the next video.
