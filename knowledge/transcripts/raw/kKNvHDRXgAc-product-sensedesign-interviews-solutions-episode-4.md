[00:00] Do you struggle to brainstorm creative solutions to product design and product sense questions
[00:07] like design a product to help people find doctors?
[00:12] Here are three tips that I use with my clients to help them come up with creative and
[00:18] stand out solutions under pressure.
[00:21] Hey guys, I'm Zayna and I'm a senior product manager at a big tech company in Silicon Valley,
[00:28] California.
[00:29] And I bring you the best tips to get in a product management and teach you how to succeed
[00:34] once you've made it.
[00:36] To brainstorm creative solutions, where are you going to go through three of my top tips
[00:42] to help you come up with creative solutions?
[00:45] The first one is identify specific pain points.
[00:50] The more you unique your pain point, the higher the chance that it hasn't already been
[00:55] addressed by another interview candidate.
[00:58] Second, use trends and technologies.
[01:02] How can technologies like AI, AR, VR, crypto or trends like short form videos be applied
[01:11] to the problem you're trying to solve?
[01:14] The third tip is to borrow from other verticals.
[01:19] Ask yourself how are other verticals solving a similar problem?
[01:23] So let's dive in.
[01:25] The number one, identify specific pain points.
[01:29] If your pain point is specific and largely unsolved, there's a higher chance you'll
[01:34] come up with a solution that isn't already solved or isn't well known.
[01:40] For example, the question, design a product to help people find doctors.
[01:45] Most candidates will use the pain point.
[01:48] Well, there's no central directory for all the doctors for people to search and discover.
[01:54] And as a result, most candidates will say, well, let's just build a platform where it houses
[02:02] all doctors and allows people to search using filters.
[02:07] This isn't wrong and it's actually very practical.
[02:12] The problem is it already exists.
[02:15] It's called ZockDock.
[02:18] How many times have you fallen into a trap like that?
[02:21] So the best way to avoid falling into this trap is just avoiding generic pain points entirely.
[02:29] How do you avoid coming up with generic pain points?
[02:33] Here is one of my videos talking specifically about how to come up with novel pain points.
[02:39] I'll link it in the description for you below.
[02:41] Now, again, that was a generic pain point.
[02:43] So what's a better pain point?
[02:45] A better pain point could be people struggle to make an informed decision on which doctor to pick
[02:53] because they don't know which criteria they should optimize for to get them the best outcome.
[03:00] Now, try to think about some solutions to this problem and see if the solutions end up being
[03:06] a bit more creative than your answers to the last pain point of not having doctors in one directory.

[03:20] We're trying to hit a thousand subscribers and really appreciate this community we built so far.
[03:27] All right, let's tackle the second tip.
[03:29] Using trends and technologies.
[03:32] Applying technologies like AI, VR, AR, crypto, yes, all the jargon words you've heard in tech,
[03:41] or even trends like short form video, aka TikTok, or influencer marketing,
[03:49] like you're seeing with YouTube, applying these novel technologies and trends to new use cases
[03:56] can really help you come up with a standout solution.
[04:00] For example, we could use AI to personalize your experience by learning the good experiences
[04:07] you've had with certain doctors and the bad experiences and end up recommending you
[04:12] future doctors that you might like. A common mistake people make here and trip up on
[04:18] is they end up throwing around these jargon words without really understanding them.
[04:24] And if you're not comfortable with the technology, feel free to use trends instead.
[04:30] Tip number three, borrow from other verticals.
[04:34] Feel free to take inspiration from other verticals and how they're tackling the problem you're
[04:40] trying to tackle. For example, if you're designing a product to help people find doctors,
[04:45] you can ask yourself, how are other verticals helping people find things?
[04:50] Think about Tinder. They help you find things by giving you a bunch of random options.
[04:55] And as you like and dislike the options, they begin to learn how to improve their recommendations to you.
[05:03] What about in e-commerce? How do they help people find things?
[05:06] Well, they use a ton of filters to help users narrow down the types of product that they want.
[05:13] Using these three tips will greatly increase your chances of coming up with a novel creative
[05:20] solution. Again, if this video is helpful, make sure to like the video, subscribe to the channel,

[05:30] Thanks guys!
