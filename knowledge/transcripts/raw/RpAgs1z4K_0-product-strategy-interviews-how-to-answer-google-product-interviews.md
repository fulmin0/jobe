[00:00] Do you struggle with questions like what should company X build next?
[00:05] That's hard. That's super hard.
[00:07] So in this video, we're going to tackle how to come up with the framework to tackle these questions.
[00:13] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a big tech company based in Silicon
[00:19] Valley, California. So product managers, one of their sole responsibilities is the come up with
[00:25] strategy and think about it. Product managers are often cited as a CEO of their product spaces
[00:32] and hence they're expected to be answering CEO level questions because they want to hire
[00:38] product managers who can think big picture and long term. First, I'm going to go over some
[00:44] typical strategy questions that are asked and second, we're going to go through a framework to
[00:48] answer some of those questions. So firstly, what are some typical strategy questions?
[00:54] For example, you're the CEO for company X. What would you build? Or let's say what's
[01:01] Apple's given a billion dollars? What would you do with that money? Or what is the five year roadmap
[01:06] for company Z should Amazon enter the smartphone market? Should YouTube buy Netflix?
[01:13] In this video, we're only going to go through the top few questions and those questions tend to be
[01:20] more broad and ambiguous. They're looking for the next big idea like the event of mobile and
[01:26] smartphones in the early 2000s or concepts like the metaverse or trends like cloud computing, AI,
[01:36] ARVR. Those are the things that CEOs are tasked with. If you look at the recent rebranding of
[01:42] Facebook into metaverse, mark the CEO was basically having to come up with in the next decade
[01:50] how do we want to see our company moving forward? And by the way for these questions,
[01:54] they don't necessarily need you to come up with a technology like ARVR, but what could also be
[01:59] innovative thinking is how you use those technologies for certain use cases. So our framework for
[02:05] answering questions like what should company X invest in next? Or if WhatsApp had a billion dollars
[02:12] what should it invest in next? Start with three main components. First, the company, second,
[02:18] the ecosystem and opportunities, and thirdly, execution. So why we start off with the company is first,
[02:25] if we want to figure out what to build in the next five years, we need help understanding what
[02:29] does the company care about? And hence the first subsection under company is what is the mission of
[02:36] the company? So if we look at companies like Google, their mission is to take the world information,
[02:42] organize it, and make it accessible and useful for everyone. If we look at Facebook's mission,
[02:47] it's to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
[02:52] So those help you understand what the companies care about. The second section is investments.
[02:59] What is the company currently investing in in terms of spaces that help and fulfill their mission?
[03:06] So if we look at Google, some of the things that they've invested in are an operating system
[03:11] like Android. And from that, they've invested in devices like the Pixel phone. And from devices
[03:18] they've expanded to other hardware devices like Wi-Fi routers and the Google Home. Beyond that,
[03:25] their key focus, of course, has been the search engine and that's where the biggest strength is.
[03:31] And from the search engine, they built a really strong ads monetization platform.
[03:37] And I can go on and on because Google has so many products. Because that gives you an idea of
[03:42] what are the spaces that they occupy already? I could be interested in building more deeply into.
[03:49] The third part under company is understanding the company's strengths. So some of the most
[03:55] successful companies have continued to succeed because it builds off its strengths.
[04:01] It combines its strengths with new spaces in order to make them even stronger.
[04:06] So if we think about Google's case, their strength was the search engine. And it's been multiple
[04:12] decades and they're still the market leader. And hence, they leverage that strength and build on it.
[04:19] So for example, YouTube probably leverages really strong search engine algorithms to help you when
[04:26] you search find videos that are the most relevant to you so that you keep watching videos on YouTube.
[04:32] So here, what are the three to five strengths from this company that you'll be able to leverage to
[04:38] figure out what the company should be building for the next five years? And the fourth part under
[04:43] company is what is the goal this company is trying to optimize for? And here, based on what you select,
[04:50] your answer is going to vary pretty differently. So a couple options, the company might be optimizing for
[04:57] growing to new users or engaging existing users or monetizing existing users or
[05:06] cutting costs or plainly innovating without a concrete step to monetize it. For example,
[05:13] if the company is trying to monetize more, it might not try to go for new users that have
[05:20] lower lifetime value. Hence, selecting one to two goals max in terms of what the company wants
[05:27] to focus on can help you focus your answer. By the way, if you want to see a framework to answer
[05:33] the latter set of questions like should YouTube buy Netflix, we're going to come up with a separate
[05:40] video to answer that. So if you don't want to miss the video, make sure to subscribe to the channel
[05:44] and turn on those notification bell. So the second section of this framework is ecosystem and
[05:51] opportunities. Here, we want to understand what's going on in the market that could be large opportunities.
[05:58] So this makes sure that we go beyond just the limitations of what the company is currently investing in
[06:04] and what the company strengths are. But what is happening in the market? That's a huge need
[06:10] or that's a big problem. So the first thing we start with to ground us in what thing we should invest in
[06:17] is who the users were tackling. And this can be dependent on what we're optimizing for as the
[06:23] goal that we talked about in this last step. For example, if we're going for new users, then the
[06:29] users you want to figure out are who are the users that are currently not using our products.
[06:35] If you're focused on monetizing more, you might try to figure out who are the users that have the
[06:39] most willingness to pay. If you want to figure out how to engage existing users, you need to understand
[06:46] who are the existing users for this company's products. If your goal is to innovate, you want to
[06:51] think what are gigantic problems that this company might care about. And lastly, if you're trying to
[06:58] cut costs, well, which part of the company and the people in that organization are contributing the
[07:05] highest costs? So that's how you can help narrow down which users you might focus on to build something
[07:12] for the next five years. And here, you'll usually want to choose users that comprise of a large group.
[07:20] Again, this question is it's how you can think, ambitiously, and long-term. So beyond just defining
[07:29] the users that you might want to focus on, that's going to help you think, what are the big gaps
[07:36] that these users are experiencing that we could be solving for? You want to think, what are the
[07:41] largest gaps versus just what are general gaps? The second section under ecosystem and opportunities
[07:49] is to come up with trends. So now that we have an idea of the users and what are their big gaps,
[07:55] what are trends we're seeing in the ecosystem related to some of these spaces? Because that can
[08:01] give you some inspiration on what are growing trends happening and burgeoning. And then you might
[08:07] want to mix a couple of the trends to come up with something that's really innovative.
[08:11] Thirdly, it's hard to talk about the market without thinking, who are the competitors in this space?
[08:19] Whether it's general competitors of this company or you want to think about competitors that are
[08:24] doing something to tackle the big gaps that you identified for the users that they care about.
[08:31] And here, beyond just identifying them, you want to talk about what are the successful strategies
[08:37] that these companies took in order to grow, succeed, monetize. Because this can also serve as
[08:43] inspiration for your own strategy. In terms of either something that you want to copy or something
[08:49] that you might want to do even better. And step number four in this section is to come up with
[08:55] three to five opportunity areas and then prioritizing one based on a criteria. And here's the
[09:03] heart of the answer. Basically, you coming up with something that is a big need for the users
[09:09] that you care about that encompasses and solves for the goal is leveraging the strengths of the
[09:15] company. And you'll want to use all of the assessment that happened before this part to get you
[09:21] towards a solid answer for the three to five opportunity areas. And the work here is really
[09:27] brainstorming and you'll want to take a couple minutes to think silently. The third section is
[09:32] execution. Basically, now that you know the space that you might want to invest in the next five
[09:37] years, how do you make it happen? Because they want to hire someone who can take that idea and get
[09:44] buy-in, get support from consumers, and then make it happen in getting more adoption. So the first
[09:51] part under execution is what is the strategic narrative that you're going to be telling your
[09:57] leadership team, your team, your consumers, the company in order to help them understand
[10:04] who you're talking for, what big gaps you're talking for, how this is aligned to the company's
[10:10] mission and what strengths you're leveraging. And so this almost resembles an investor pitch.
[10:15] The second step is then what is the roadmap for the next two to five years. Break it down by every
[10:21] six months or every year, what milestones you want to hit and what you want to accomplish or what
[10:26] you want to do for the next five years to make the end goal happen. So that's reflecting the long-term
[10:32] thinking and the process of how to make something happen. And the third step is how do you get started
[10:38] today? So within the next six months, what are you going to do? And here you want to list out some
[10:45] steps that you immediately want to start doing to make progress in this space. And the fourth part
[10:52] of the execution section is what risks do we imagine will come up. And this is really important
[10:58] because they want to hire product managers who can think ahead of time what risks can come up
[11:04] and come up with a plan to make sure they don't fail. And if you're wondering what other type of
[11:10] questions that you might be asked in the product interview, well you're probably going to be asked
[11:15] and execution questions. So take a look at this video here sharing what are best tips to help you
[11:22] answer the product's sense question and the product execution question. And these questions tend
[11:27] to be a bit more narrowed because they give you something like what product would you build in
[11:32] for free at the beginning of the year to begin.
