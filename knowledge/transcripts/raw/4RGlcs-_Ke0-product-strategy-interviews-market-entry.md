[00:00] Product strategy questions like should Amazon enter the smartphone market are tough,
[00:06] but in this video I'm going to share a framework with you on how to tackle these questions so you can rock these interviews.
[00:14] We're going to be tackling a market entry product strategy question like should Amazon enter the smartphone market?
[00:22] And this is going to be a six part framework.
[00:26] So the first part we're going to evaluate in tackling this question is what is the goal with why Amazon would want to enter the smartphone market in the first place?
[00:37] This to understand the company's motivation behind taking a certain action.
[00:42] Businesses don't do things for random reasons. They usually have some motive. So it could be a couple things.
[00:50] The first we're thinking this could be a good way for Amazon to earn more money from the profit margin of selling phones.
[00:58] The margin on selling smartphones are no joke. On the low end it's closer to 20% on the high end like Apple smartphones.
[01:06] It's closer to 60-70%. Yes, every time you buy a smartphone Apple earns around 60-70%.
[01:15] And that is why they're one of the most valued companies in the world.
[01:20] Another reason why could be Amazon perhaps increasing their revenues by using the metadata that they capture from your usage of their smartphone to lead you to buy more on Amazon, their core business.
[01:34] And another reason why could be a smartphone could help with their device ecosystem that they've been investing in.
[01:41] So you've seen their investment in things like Alexa in devices like the Kindle, Fire TV.
[01:49] And they're always dreaming up new ways to build hardware.
[01:53] By the way, let you in on a sticker. And we actually did try to build their own smartphone.
[01:58] And I don't think it turned out very well. But we're going to go through this question anyways.
[02:02] By Amazon investing in a smartphone, it could help them with device interoperability between multiple devices.
[02:11] Similar to how for Apple, you have your watch. I have my watch.
[02:15] And you have an iPad and a phone and all of them work together to build even more value for you.
[02:22] And this in turn could help them monetize Alexa in a more profitable way than their Alexa home devices.
[02:29] And one last reason why I'm not might be interested in investing in the smartphone market is for competitive parity.
[02:36] Basically, Amazon feels fomo that its competitors like Google and Apple have smartphones and are innovating in that space.
[02:45] And they want to get in on that too.
[02:47] Next, when businesses decide whether to enter a market, they want to evaluate the actual market.
[02:54] So things like how big is the market? And this is covering total addressable market, which is basically because the people and how many people would possibly buy your product.
[03:04] On top of that, also what is the potential revenue based off of the number of people that would buy it?
[03:09] Also, is this market growing or is it declining?
[03:12] Other things to consider in the market are who are the existing competitors and what are their market share like?
[03:19] What are the customers' needs and expectations for this product?
[03:24] And last, so what are some macro factors that we should consider?
[03:27] First, let's tackle the size of this market.
[03:30] I'm going to do some really rough math, so do not take this as truth.
[03:35] But let's think.
[03:37] So generally, I know that there are about more devices out there than there are people.
[03:42] So I'm going to say there's about 7 billion devices out there.
[03:46] I don't know exactly how many smartphone devices, but let's assume it's 50%.
[03:50] So that gives me about 3.5 billion devices that are smartphones out there.
[03:55] And if people are changing up smartphones every three years,
[03:59] I'm going to just cut down my number to 3 billion to make the math easier.
[04:03] That gives me about 1 billion dollar devices that are going to be bought each year.
[04:09] And if I then assume that Amazon might take a 5% market share,
[04:14] that gives me about 50 million devices a year.
[04:18] And if I then assume that the profit margin on each of these devices are around $200,
[04:25] that gives me about $10 billion of possible profit in just one year.
[04:31] If I'm possibly counting just the US,
[04:35] and again, I do this math where there's 300 million people.
[04:39] Every 30 years, there's a device upgrade that gives me around 100 million devices,
[04:45] smartphones.
[04:46] Again, if I capture 5% of that, that's 5 million a year.
[04:51] And then if the price is, let's say $300 per device,
[04:55] that equates to $1.5 billion just in the US alone if that was our first target market.
[05:02] So this market in terms of the number of people is pretty large,
[05:07] and in terms of the size of the revenue slash profit is also pretty darn big.
[05:15] So this kind of validates the first reason why Amazon would be interested in entering the smartphone market.
[05:21] Again, these numbers are not exact,
[05:23] but it gives me some semblance of, is market small or large?
[05:28] And I added factors to make the number a bit more conservative by saying 5% of the market share.
[05:34] The other question is, is this a growing market or a declining market?
[05:38] And we know with smartphones,
[05:40] it's a growing market because the internet is only getting more prevalent.
[05:45] In other emerging markets,
[05:47] the internet is getting more affordable,
[05:49] which means it's going to be used more.
[05:51] And another trend that we see is that some people have two devices,
[05:55] one personal device and one that their company gives them.
[05:59] Next, we want to talk about the competitors who have existing market share.
[06:04] And you are probably on a Samsung or an iPhone device,
[06:09] because those are the dominant players for mid to high-end devices.
[06:14] And then on the bottom threshold of those selling smartphones in other markets that are cheaper,
[06:20] you have companies like Trenchin.
[06:22] Then we're going to think about customer needs.
[06:24] In the smartphone market,
[06:26] customers have a lot of loyalty to their brand.
[06:30] So for example, for me, the first smartphone I had was an Apple device,
[06:35] and it's been what, 10 years later, and I've sticked with Apple.
[06:38] I know this is a very hot debate between those who use Apple devices,
[06:42] those who use Android devices, talking to you engineers.
[06:45] And a lot of the people tend to not make the switch.
[06:49] So not just with operating system,
[06:51] Android versus iOS,
[06:53] but I'm talking about even the device brand.
[06:55] So I've stuck with Apple,
[06:57] but I consider Samsung,
[06:58] I don't think so at this point.
[07:01] But comment below and let me know which of you guys use Android devices.
[07:06] So people rarely switch unless the features on and on the device are differentiated,
[07:12] are super special.
[07:13] And you kind of see this happening the last five years with Google's Pixel device,
[07:19] where people are sharding to buy Pixel devices because they have awesome cameras,
[07:23] awesome photo quality, etc.
[07:25] And lastly, we want to talk about macro factors that are impacting the smartphone market.
[07:30] So a big one is a lot of the smartphones out there are dominated by just a few players
[07:36] in terms of OEMs and ODMs.
[07:38] Those are original device manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers.
[07:43] So this might mean if Amazon goes to procure smartphone devices,
[07:48] because they wouldn't necessarily built it themselves,
[07:50] they might not get such a competitive price
[07:52] because these other players are supporting the Samsung Huawei's of the world.
[07:57] Third, we're going to talk about strength of Amazon,
[08:01] impossibly entering the smartphone space.
[08:03] And usually, strengths could cover things like distribution channels,
[08:07] economies of scale to get lower costs,
[08:10] brand, maybe patents they have, or product advantages.
[08:13] And for Amazon, their biggest strength is their distribution channel.
[08:18] Most people are buying something off of Amazon,
[08:21] so if they were to sell smartphones,
[08:23] they wouldn't have to partner with the reseller
[08:25] who takes a significant markup from say Apple,
[08:29] but they wouldn't sell it through their own channels on Amazon.
[08:32] And it wouldn't be like Apple where they need to operate a physical store.
[08:36] So they could definitely help them earn more profit margin than other brands.
[08:40] Another strength could be the features that are on the phone.
[08:44] So because of their strength in Alexa,
[08:46] they can build, let's say, a hand off smartphone.
[08:49] If Alexa can get that good,
[08:51] because we all know Alexa is sort of a one trick pony still.
[08:56] Next, we're going to talk about what does it cost to enter this market?
[09:00] Think about it.
[09:01] A company might be really interested in entering a market,
[09:04] but if the cost is so high that they can never recover those costs from the sales,
[09:10] they might think twice about investing, or they should.
[09:13] But then not all companies are rational in that way.
[09:16] Sometimes companies decide to innovate for the sake of it,
[09:19] even if they see no return.
[09:20] So think about the cost to enter.
[09:22] The two major costs that Amazon's going to incur
[09:25] is the hardware costs of building out the smartphone
[09:29] and the team that's going to build a software to incorporate into the devices.
[09:33] On a device side, they're most likely going a partner with an original device manufacturer
[09:38] to produce this smartphone.
[09:40] And these companies have a minimum order usually.
[09:43] Let's say I'm going to make up a number.
[09:46] 100,000 device is the minimum order.
[09:48] And let's say what Amazon would need to pay the device manufacturer is $100 per device.
[09:53] Again, I'm making up that number just to give us an idea of how much it could cost.
[09:58] So that 100,000 time $100 per device,
[10:02] that's about $10 million to pay for the hardware.
[10:06] And by the way, this device minimum is say per year.
[10:09] So that's $10 million per year.
[10:11] Next, we have the people resources.
[10:14] So I think this is going to be a 50 people team.
[10:18] And I think that's kind of conservative.
[10:19] Might be more than that.
[10:20] But initially starting out the first year, 50 people assuming a salary of $200,000
[10:28] and this encompasses of a lot more things like benefits, et cetera.
[10:32] That's going to cost another $10 million.
[10:36] So added up, this investment is going to cost them $20 million in the first year alone.
[10:42] So Amazon has to think about by what year do I recoup these costs?
[10:47] It doesn't necessarily have to break even in the first year,
[10:50] but over a long-term horizon.
[10:52] If Amazon wants to make this business line profitable,
[10:56] they'll have to think about recouping these costs by sales,
[11:00] whether from the direct business of Amazon or from the smartphone devices itself.
[11:05] Step number five.
[11:07] So note for these type of questions,
[11:10] because you don't have all the data,
[11:12] instead of getting to a decision of yes or no,
[11:15] my advice is to get to a decision tree.
[11:19] So basically, yes,
[11:22] Amazon should enter the smartphone market, given these factors.
[11:26] No, Amazon should not enter the smartphone market,
[11:30] given XYZ factors.
[11:32] I like this method because it doesn't put so much pressure on having to pick one way or the other,
[11:38] but rather saying, given certain data,
[11:41] I would go this way versus that way.
[11:44] And this really helps your interviewer show the thinking behind your analysis,
[11:49] which is what they care about.
[11:51] At the end of the day, these interviews are not looking for a right answer,
[11:55] but rather how you think through tackling the question.
[11:59] So my decision trees,
[12:00] yes, Amazon should enter the smartphone market.
[12:03] If the profit margins are indeed closer to 50%,
[12:08] and that if they feel confident,
[12:10] they can take 5% of the market at the very least,
[12:13] within the next three years,
[12:15] and possibly even break even within the next three to five years.
[12:19] Their key to getting 5% of the market share will need to be special features
[12:24] that to Frenchate themselves from the existing players like Amazon, Samsung, Google Pixel now.
[12:30] So maybe incorporating Alexa in a way where there's a hand-off device,
[12:34] which I don't believe any of the smartphone devices today have accomplished yet.
[12:38] Secondly, no,
[12:40] Amazon should not enter the smartphone market.
[12:44] If we find that from surveying or a test that customers are so loyal
[12:50] to their device brand,
[12:52] that they would not consider switching.
[12:54] Or if Amazon isn't able to come up with any differentiated features,
[12:59] that make them, let's say,
[13:01] five times or twice as better as the Pixel,
[13:04] the Apple smartphone or the Samsung smartphones.
[13:07] Maybe they could possibly compete on price,
[13:10] but then we'll have to evaluate,
[13:12] are they going to be able to break even and make money off this business?
[13:16] Because if they sell it for way too low,
[13:18] just to compete with the players,
[13:20] they might struggle to actually make money off of this investment.
[13:25] And the last part of the analysis,
[13:28] step number six is how would Amazon enter this smartphone market?
[13:33] And there's three ways to think about it.
[13:35] First, Amazon could consider doing it themselves,
[13:38] which is basically building devices themselves,
[13:41] building the hardware, et cetera.
[13:43] I don't think this is a very smart idea.
[13:45] They don't have strengths or expertise building hardware.
[13:49] So if anything,
[13:50] they might go for the second option,
[13:51] which is partnering or outsourcing the device creation
[13:56] to original device manufacturers with expertise building smartphones.
[14:01] So this could be a pretty viable option.
[14:03] And the last option is they could buy a company.
[14:07] By buying this company,
[14:08] if it was less than $20 million,
[14:11] which is what we said it would cost them
[14:13] to invest in this space.
[14:15] And it could help them get the device to market earlier.
[14:19] This could be a worthy way to enter the smartphone market.
[14:22] So now let's summarize the framework we walked through in the six steps.
[14:27] The first, we tackled the goal.
[14:30] Why does X company want to invest in this market?
[14:33] Why would it be beneficial for them?
[14:35] The second is how large is the market?
[14:38] How many people is it growing?
[14:41] Who are the competitors?
[14:43] What are the users' needs?
[14:44] And what are some macro factors in this market?
[14:47] They should know.
[14:48] The third, what strengths do the companies have to lend to this space?
[14:54] So they feel confident that they could win in this space.
[14:57] Fourth, what does it cost to enter?
[15:00] And the investment needed to invest in this space.
[15:02] Number five, a decision tree.
[15:05] Yes, if these factors,
[15:08] no, do not enter if these factors.
[15:11] And number six is what is the best way to enter the market?
[15:16] Through doing it themselves,
[15:17] a partnership slash outsourcing,
[15:19] or should they buy a company?
[15:21] So this was our framework to tackle.
[15:24] Should Amazon enter the smartphone market?
[15:27] Another type of product strategy question you'll get is
[15:31] what should company X do in the next five years?
[15:34] This is another tough and ambiguous question.
[15:37] So you don't want to miss this video that shows you
[15:40] how to tackle this question with the framework.
[15:42] And I will see you guys in the next video.
