[00:00] In this video, we're going to go through more advanced tips to help you think more strategically
[00:09] for the product sense product strategy questions like what would you build for blank?
[00:18] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a large tech company based in Silicon
[00:24] Valley, California. And one of the main struggles that I see in people answering product strategy
[00:30] questions is a struggle to think deeply about the problem space. Most of them will go through the
[00:36] four part framework of mission, user segmentation, pain points and solutions, so they'll do that fine,
[00:43] but they'll struggle to think deeply in each of the sections so it makes it seem like they're
[00:48] going through the motions rather than thinking about the actual problem space. And a lot of people say
[00:53] it's because they haven't experienced the prompt that the interviewer might have asked them about.
[00:59] So in this video, we're going to give you some tips that will help you think deeply about the
[01:04] problem space even if you had not experienced it before. So what are we going to cover? We're going
[01:09] to cover two things. The first, we're going to go over the product sense framework and help you
[01:15] understand what are the objective of each section and how does this translate into what you would do
[01:21] on the job. So this might help you think, well, as a product manager, how would I solve this
[01:26] type of problem in my own day to day? And second, we'll cover the tip on how you can think deeply
[01:33] in each of these sections. So let's dive into the first part of the product sense framework,
[01:38] which is answering the question, why should we build this?
[01:44] And here, the objective is to get the interviewer excited about the problem space that you're
[01:50] building for because think about it. How does this translate into the job? Well, as a product
[01:56] manager, if you're assigned a problem space, you probably have to first educate whether it's leadership
[02:03] or your organization or your core team about the problems in the space. And then you'll want to get
[02:09] them excited to invest a bunch of resources and a bunch of dollars into the space. How you might
[02:17] think about this is think about it as an investor pitch or think about this as pitching the CEO
[02:23] of the company that you're interviewing for. So that's the case, what might you cover? Well,
[02:28] one of the first things we talked about educating your audience on the problem space is to talk
[02:33] about trends, market gaps, and any opportunities that might present itself. And here, this is hugely
[02:40] important because if you want to persuade your audience that they should do something or that this
[02:46] space is important, you want to get them in the same context. For example, if I was asked about
[02:51] antique buying, maybe the average person wouldn't think much of the industry. But if I had some
[02:57] information to say, wow, one of the biggest trends in retail is people really like buying old stuff
[03:03] versus new stuff. One, because of the whole recycling or climate change concept where people want to
[03:09] help the planet by buying used goods. So that could be something that the average person might not
[03:15] know. And if you share that with them, they'd better understand why we should be investing in a
[03:19] space that might seem not the sexiest. So when we're talking about investor pitches, another thing
[03:25] that comes to mind often is talking about the size of the market. So how many times have you heard in
[03:31] one of these pitches, oh, this is a two billion dollar opportunity or this is a 200 million people
[03:38] problem. So numerating how big the space is can show your audience or your leadership in this case,
[03:45] why this is such a big opportunity to invest your dollars into. Because think about it,
[03:50] these companies want to make sure they're investing in something that's hugely impactful,
[03:55] that I'm going to get them some ROI return on investment. Third is aligning it to the company's
[04:01] mission that you're being asked about. So here on the job as the product manager, you'll have to help
[04:06] your leadership understand why building in the space is aligned with what they're trying to accomplish
[04:12] as a whole. Because if it's totally not aligned, they're going to be like, well, why are we doing this?
[04:18] This is not a goal of ours. And you'll also want to talk about strengths that the company can leverage.
[04:24] So a lot of the times, sure, there might be a really sexy space. Some of them might ask, well,
[04:29] why is this important for us to build? What if we don't have the strengths to build in this space?
[04:34] Are we the best? And here, many companies have gone really successful by leveraging their strengths
[04:41] and adding on to the strengths versus spending all their time covering the weaknesses.
[04:46] And the last element of the section of why should we build this is thinking about how is this
[04:51] going to benefit the company? And this is one of the most important ones that people forget.
[04:57] So sure, you're being asked to solve a people problem, but at the end of the day, a company will
[05:02] have to build it. And if it's not benefiting the company in some way, whether that's getting
[05:07] them new users or helping them grow revenues or helping them expand to a new space,
[05:13] then why would the company build it? So this is how you think more strategically in this section.
[05:21] Now let's talk about the second section of the product sense question, user segmentation.
[05:27] And here, your objective is to come up with user segments where their problems are uniquely
[05:34] different and that the user segments are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive.
[05:41] Or Misi, why? Because on the job, you're going to have to define who your target users that you
[05:48] want to build for. So you might consider prioritizing the early adopters or you might go straight for
[05:54] the mass majority to build for. So here, it's important to prioritize because we have limited
[06:00] resources as a company and we need to keep focused on starting with one group to build for.
[06:05] So how do you even come up with some user segments? So here, the exercise that I tell the people
[06:11] that I work with when preparing for interviews is to think about really concrete examples related
[06:17] to the topic. So for example, if we're talking about the grocery shopping experience, you'll
[06:23] want to ask yourself the last time I went to the grocery store, what were some of the personas
[06:27] that I saw there? For me, the first thing that comes to mind is seeing parents with their children
[06:33] there. So that starts off my brainstorm. And then how do you get it to be mutually exclusive
[06:38] and comprehensively exhaustive? I then start thinking about buckets and maybe opposites.
[06:45] So if there's the case of families, then I start thinking about, okay, there's also single people
[06:49] who are not married and have kids. And then there are couples who are not married yet.
[06:55] And you see how that's definitely mutually exclusive because if you're single, you're also not
[06:59] married and are criteria that we talked about where there are distinctive needs, that also presents
[07:06] itself to be true because a family or parents are feeding a mouth of five people versus a single
[07:12] person might purchase less food because they're eating out more often. Here, it's starting out with
[07:18] very concrete examples to help you brainstorm. So another way I like to think about this,
[07:23] and here I share this in a previous video, is thinking about who are the least frequent users
[07:28] and who are the most frequent users of this space. So let's take grocery shopping. And here,
[07:34] you want to come up with specific personas. So if I'm thinking about the most frequent shoppers,
[07:40] that again leads me to realize, oh, well families probably have to go shopping once a week at the
[07:45] very least to get fresh produce because they also have to feed again three to five mouths.
[07:51] And then you might brainstorm other personas for the least frequent are those who are probably
[07:56] ordering Uber Eats or DoorDash every day. And a lot of these people probably tend to be single
[08:02] because they can afford it. But here's how you sort of finagle the art of user segmentation
[08:07] because it really is an art versus a science. And here, you don't have to strive to be perfect,
[08:12] but strive to be mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive or you're covering
[08:17] let's say 80% of the population versus 100% of the population. Other ways people think about
[08:23] user segments is motivation or use cases. So for the grocery shopping experience, someone that
[08:29] I was working with and preparing them for the product interviews, I talked about use cases like
[08:34] someone who is going to the grocery store for a quick pickup and go to buy stuff for a picnic.
[08:40] Another use case was people buying for their family to cook for the week. So that could be
[08:45] another way to slice and dice it, but sometimes it's not as mutually exclusive as the fritley
[08:51] frequent versus most frequent dichotomy. The one that people default to the most is life stages.
[08:58] And that one is definitely mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive, but it doesn't hit
[09:05] the first criteria of people having the stink needs because sometimes for certain topics,
[09:11] someone that's 50 versus someone that's 20 might not have very distinctive needs. And then once
[09:17] you come up with these segments, how might you prioritize? And here the tip is to leverage objective
[09:24] criteria versus subjective. Why? Because subjective might be harder to prove and to argue.
[09:31] For example, of subjective criteria is, oh, I'll choose this user segment because they have more
[09:36] needs. Well, you might think they have more needs, but I might not think they have more needs.
[09:41] Versus an objective criteria such as what is the size of this population or what is their
[09:46] frequency of using this type of product? Maybe what is their willingness to spend or their
[09:52] disposable income? These are things where I might be able to get factual data on in order to prove
[09:58] that a certain user segment optimizes on these criteria. Has this video been helpful so far?
[10:04] If so, make sure to like the video and share this with someone else as preparing for the product
[10:08] interviews. And we're also thinking about doing a similar advanced video like this for product
[10:14] execution. So if you're interested, make sure to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss the
[10:19] video when we get it live. So third section in the product sense question are pain points.
[10:28] Here your objective is to empathize and be able to come up with four to six pain points.
[10:34] How does this translate on the job? Well, as a product manager, we're constantly doing user
[10:39] research on the people that we're trying to build for. And hence we're interviewing these people
[10:45] asking about their needs. And here the tip is the more specific your pain point, the more
[10:51] differentiated your solution will end up being. So for example, if we go back to the antique buying
[10:56] one, if the pain point that you're prioritizing is it's hard to search for antique stores,
[11:02] while the solution you're going to come up with is probably let's create a directory
[11:06] of antique stores and allow people to search based on where they're located,
[11:11] versus if you focus on a more specific pain point with the antique buying journey,
[11:17] which might be negotiating with the antique seller, which is a struggle. Sometimes I might value
[11:22] a product much more differently if there's not an actual price tag on it. So here the solutions
[11:28] you might come up with might end up being more interesting than a directory. But also be careful
[11:34] not to have the pain point be too granular because sometimes that might push you into the zone
[11:40] of coming up with a feature rather than a product. So you don't want solutions that say you're
[11:45] going to build a button to do X. That's way too granular. So here people struggle to come up with
[11:52] pain points because it might be hard to empathize on certain topics and even for topics that they
[11:59] are able to empathize on, they're scared to think of their own experience because they think that
[12:03] my bias to answer too much. So how do you become more empathetic? So if you want to come up with deeper
[12:09] pain points, I actually highly suggest you to use your experiences. But use your experiences that
[12:15] you think is generalizable to the population. So here I like to think of the three spheres of empathy.
[12:22] The first sphere starts with asking yourself about your personal experience. When was the last time
[12:29] you did X and thinking deeply about that experience and that process from beginning to the end?
[12:35] The second sphere, let's say you would never experience this personally. Then you would think about
[12:41] well, are there any friends or family that have experienced this and told me about it? Or have you
[12:47] seen something about this experience on TV? Use that to recall what were their struggles when
[12:54] talking to you about it. And the third sphere of empathy is visualize yourself in that experience
[13:02] and think what would I need to do from the beginning to the end to accomplish this thing?
[13:09] And that's going to force you into very concrete parts of the experience to then figure out a
[13:15] user journey and then some pain points. So it's basically putting yourself in someone else's shoes
[13:21] and asking what next? What next? Till you get to the very end? You'll first start off with the user
[13:27] journey, which is what is the process from beginning to end to accomplish that thing? And then you go
[13:32] deep into each phase of the user journey to ask what sucks or what was something that was frustrating
[13:40] in this experience. And trust me, even if you haven't experienced it yourself, you'd be able to
[13:45] come up with some ideas on what are just general annoyances that might occur when you're trying to
[13:50] accomplish something. And how do you prioritize here? The prioritization criteria here is a bit more
[13:56] subjective than the one we talked about in user segmentation. So some criteria that are going to
[14:01] help you prioritize are the pain level? Are there existing solutions out there for solving this
[14:07] pain? What is the size of the targeted users that are experiencing this pain? And which of these
[14:12] pain points are leveraging the company's strengths that they are advantageously positioned to solve?
[14:18] Here you want to choose just two or three of those criteria and don't use all of them because
[14:22] that will make it a really, really long analysis. Do you have other strategies that you've used
[14:27] in tackling product sense product strategy questions that has worked really well? Or are there other
[14:32] things that you struggle with in this question? Comment below and let me know what they are and they
[14:37] could be a great topic for the next video. And the last and final portion is the solution section.
[14:46] And here the objective is to come up with solutions that solve the pain point that you were talking
[14:51] about and make sure your solutions isn't something that already exists in the market. And how does
[14:57] this apply on the job? Well, when you're asked to solve for a problem space, you and your team probably
[15:03] have to brainstorm some solutions once you understand what the pain points are. One of the most
[15:07] common problems people have here is being solution led versus problem led. So a lot of the candidates
[15:13] that I've interviewed in the first five minutes of the prompts being asked, they already have a solution
[15:19] in mind and they structure the whole question to get to that solution. And that'll be fairly obvious.
[15:26] And that is probably one of the largest dangers of developing products when you're not focused
[15:30] on your users' pain points, but your focus on your own solutions that you like. And the other
[15:35] struggle is people come up with solutions that already exists. So what are some strategies to help
[15:40] you think of more creative solutions in this section? So think about the company's strengths that you're
[15:46] being asked about to build this product for. So that's going to make it a really compelling answer
[15:51] if you've been taking their strengths to come up with a solution. Another strategy in developing
[15:55] creative solutions is to combine different technologies and trends. So instead of just saying,
[16:01] oh, I'm going to use ARVR to solve this problem, think how am I going to use ARVR and social to
[16:08] solve for this problem? So this combining and remixing is going to ensure that you're going to come
[16:13] up with a more interesting solution than the average population. So the tips we went over today
[16:20] are more advanced tips compared to the other product sense videos that I came up with. But if you
[16:25] want to see the other two videos and you haven't caught it yet, I'm going to share them here so
[16:28] that you can easily watch them. See you guys in the next video.
