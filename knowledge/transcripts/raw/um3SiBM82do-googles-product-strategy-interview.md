[00:00] One of the toughest product interview questions
[00:03] are what should company X build in five years?
[00:06] In this video, I'm going to walk you through a full-proof framework
[00:10] and an example to help you tackle this question
[00:13] so you ace your product interviews.
[00:15] So we're actually going to tackle what should Google build
[00:18] in the next five years. And this is tough because Google has built
[00:21] so much what haven't they touched. So we're going to first start off
[00:25] with talking about Google's business. And what is Google's mission?
[00:29] It is to organize the world information and make it universally accessible
[00:35] and useful. So some themes that they care about as you can tell
[00:40] from their mission statement, which I think is pretty unique,
[00:43] is one they care about organizing the world's information, they care about
[00:46] knowledge. Second, they care about universal accessibility
[00:50] that as many people can access knowledge information, whatever they need
[00:55] as much as possible. And you see this through their next
[00:59] billion users effort that they invested in where they're trying to bring
[01:03] other people in emerging markets in places where internet is not accessible,
[01:08] bringing the services to them. And the last theme is usefulness.
[01:14] They want to make sure that these products are useful or make a difference
[01:18] in a person's life. So my tip here is it's really important to actually
[01:23] understand and break out the mission because you're going to use this to set
[01:28] and maybe develop solutions and a vision for your product, which we'll talk about
[01:33] later on. Next, you want to spend a little bit of time
[01:36] understanding the company's products. So here, again, Google has developed so
[01:40] many products. I'm going to split them out into a couple different domains
[01:44] from hardware, software, their platform products, and innovation products.
[01:49] For example, on their software products, it's things like video youtube,
[01:54] things like Google Maps, Gmail, Google Workspace, which is really the Google
[01:58] docs drive pieces of the product. Of course, they're key flat-ship
[02:02] product that they started off with Google Search, and ads which you
[02:05] built search to monetize off of. On their harder products, they've also
[02:09] built so much in the last decades. They've built the mobile pixel phone.
[02:14] They've invested in home devices like buying Ness and then developing Google Home,
[02:20] which I have one. They built a platform by buying a small company that turn
[02:24] into their Android platform. And we all know they have innovated in self-driving cars
[02:28] being one of the early ones to invest and in other innovations such as the
[02:33] Verily, which is part of their alphabet conglomerate. They invested in Google Glass.
[02:38] So they have worked on so much, which makes this question even harder. And lastly,
[02:43] let's look at their business model. Google's business model is so that they make about 80%
[02:48] of their revenue off of ads, whether that's YouTube ads or Google's network ads or directly
[02:54] on Google Search platform. And the rest of the rate of the new might be coming from licensing
[02:59] products. For example, they started charging enterprises to use Google Workspace, Gmail, etc.
[03:05] They're also selling a lot of consumer products like the Google Home, but the chunk of their
[03:10] revenue is still coming from ads. And as we know, the advertising space is a bit shaky,
[03:16] given a lot of the regulations that we're seeing on user privacy data. So now that we understand
[03:21] Google's business, let's talk about goals. And this piece is so key to be able to make progress
[03:29] on this question, because this question of what should Google build in the next five years
[03:34] is really ambiguous. And you can go in so many different directions that it's almost overwhelming.
[03:40] So you have to narrow it down a bit by asking yourself for what purpose in the next five years.
[03:45] Is it number one to diversify its revenues? We talked about Google's revenues is about 80%
[03:51] from ads. Does it need to do a better job of diversifying beyond that and to sell other things
[03:58] so that if the ads climate comes under more regulation or tight constraint, they are not being
[04:04] or two is the goal something to fight off competition. As we've seen recently with the development
[04:10] of chat GPT by OpenAI or other contenders such as people spending so much time on TikTok,
[04:17] does Google need to fight back in some way to protect its territory? I mean, you have seen Google
[04:23] fight back on these initiatives with things like BARD which they developed which is supposed to
[04:29] rival chat GPT. I don't think it's there yet. And also YouTube shorts which is supposed to rival
[04:35] TikTok videos. Or as a goal to drive user growth, are they trying to acquire new users, get
[04:41] engagement from existing users? So that could be another goal. And when we talked about we saw
[04:46] that Google invested billions of dollars into next billion users which is to bring their services
[04:53] to those emerging markets that might not have access to internet. Or is their goal to continue
[04:58] innovating? Google is really well known to just push the boundary on spaces like self-driving cars
[05:05] for Google Glass, the internet space with these balloons. And they have so much under their
[05:11] portfolio of Google X. A lot of times they are innovating for innovation's sake. It's not clear
[05:18] in the long term whether they're going to be able to make money, but they know it's really important
[05:22] to push the boundaries because who knows what the next trend is. And they feel confident that whatever
[05:29] they come up with, such as when they started off with search, they would find a way to monetize.
[05:34] So to tackle this question, you really need to understand well what is the goal? And here you
[05:39] might ask interviewer directly whether they have any input or a lot of the times they're going to
[05:44] put it on you to prioritize what do you think the goal should be. And as always when you make
[05:49] decisions start off with the criteria. And here my criteria is which has the highest urgency
[05:54] or which has the highest impact on long-term revenue growth. So if I start to think about these
[06:01] list of four things, well today's climate in tech is a bit weird. As are talking about in 2023,
[06:08] tech has constricted a bit where we've seen even companies like Google, Patelayoff, tens of thousands
[06:15] of their employees last year in December. They had to nix their next billion users organization
[06:21] and really cut down on costs, which means they might deprioritize innovation for innovation's
[06:27] sake in the meanwhile. And hence that's going to help me eliminate number four. And they've had to
[06:32] prioritize things that have more obvious return on investment. Google has also seen to deprioritize
[06:38] acquiring a lot of new users. As I mentioned, they nix their next billion users organization,
[06:44] which means I'm going to deprioritize number three as well. So that leaves me with number one and
[06:48] number two, diversify revenue and or compete. But I think most important for Google in this
[06:54] climate is the diversify revenue to make sure that they survive. And as you might say, the competitors
[07:01] are taking a piece of Google's lunch and they need to go fight them. But you saw that competition
[07:07] does not necessarily mean a significant threat to Google survivorship. For example, Google
[07:13] was competing against Facebook as Facebook was becoming the main dominant social media player.
[07:20] And Google had developed a bunch of products that tried to rival Facebook. And it did not succeed.
[07:26] So they had tried Google Plus. There was other products in other countries that did better than
[07:31] Google Plus. But despite it not defeating Facebook, it was able to co-exist and still make a ton of money
[07:38] from ads revenue. So I might then say, yes, competition is important to push them forward. But
[07:45] beating out these competitors in their own game might not be the most critical to survivorship.
[07:51] So I'm going to prioritize diversifying revenues and keep an eye out for how to also maybe
[07:56] beat their competitors while doing that. Now the next step we now hunkered down on a goal,
[08:02] which is the diversify revenue. We need to know who we're going to be building for in order to
[08:06] determine what we're going to be building. So let's get clear on what are some users that we
[08:12] could focus on. And for Google, I would say the four key users that it could be building for.
[08:17] Again, these are very general. But the first is enterprises. And these are larger organizations,
[08:22] large companies that even though they make up a very small number of total businesses,
[08:28] they make up a chunk of the revenues or GDP of the country. The Google itself would be an
[08:35] example of one of these enterprises. Second would be small meeting businesses who make up the
[08:40] majority, something like 90% of the number of businesses. And this is the case in the US.
[08:46] Third, another type of user they target is the solo entrepreneurs. So think about with YouTube,
[08:51] they're tackling these creators who start off as solo entrepreneurs often. Or maybe they are
[08:56] working with someone else in the video. And fourth, they could be focusing on everyday consumers,
[09:01] selling things like Google Nest, Google Home, and whatever other products that we are using as
[09:07] consumers. So the criteria I'm going to use here is to look at two things. The potential revenue
[09:12] growth from this group versus the effort. And this is me basically looking at the return on investment.
[09:19] So if I think about these four groups and look at the current climate, we are kind of in a recession
[09:23] where there's high inflation and hence we might expect consumers to be spending less on digital goods.
[09:29] So I might deprioritize consumers when I think about large enterprises. Yes, they generate a ton
[09:34] of revenue and have a ton to spend. But it's also very costly to acquire them. The sales cycles
[09:40] are pretty long. And on top of that, to build for them is costlier because the quality or the
[09:47] expectations they have is going to be at a much higher regard. So now I'm left with the small
[09:52] meeting businesses or the solo entrepreneurs. And if I look at which group is going to bring a
[09:58] higher amount of potential revenue in the long term, it's going to be the small meeting businesses
[10:03] over the creators. Because when I think about the solo entrepreneurs, they have a lower
[10:07] ceiling as to how much they could be making versus a larger size business. Now that we've identified
[10:13] which users we want to be tackling for, we then want to understand what challenges of theirs
[10:18] that we can build for. So top tip here is I want you to think about challenges that are big and
[10:25] lofty versus small pain points. And that's why I call this section challenges and not pain points
[10:32] like some of the product design frameworks that you've seen the use. And that's important because
[10:37] the end solution should be something that's pretty ambitious and not like a feature. So if you narrowed
[10:44] the space and make it a pain point, it becomes too narrow to develop something that becomes a product
[10:50] suite. Again, they are asking what should Google build in the next five years. It should be something
[10:55] quite meaty. So if I look to see what are the challenges of small meeting businesses, I have two
[11:01] main categories. The first is more in operations and the second is more in group. So under operations,
[11:06] some of the big challenges they have, one starts with hiring and this includes finding the right people,
[11:12] training them and retaining their employees. I think about my own experience with my parents who
[11:18] started their small meeting business when I was in high school and their main constraint was
[11:22] finding people to work for them, which meant because it was hard to find people, they had to spend
[11:27] all their time working. A second effort of these businesses are to digitize their business.
[11:32] As we see technology optimize processes and serve as key things of communication with customers,
[11:39] businesses have been pressured to adopt these technologies that might not be very easy for businesses
[11:45] to do so. A third thing is tracking business performance. A lot of times businesses don't even
[11:50] understand the number of customers they have, the number of sales they're making and it's all
[11:54] sort of a mess and hence if they don't have the full picture, how are they going to be able to
[11:59] optimize it? And number four, on a similar vein, their financial management is a key challenge.
[12:04] Oftentimes they don't know how much capital is flowing in and how much capital is flowing out.
[12:09] What are the investments that they're making and sometimes businesses find themselves in trouble
[12:13] without even realizing it? For example, I remember one of the most famous restaurants when I was in
[12:18] Copenhagen, I will put a link of the name. So apparently even though they are the most famous and
[12:24] again top rated Michelin star restaurant, with a wait list that's basically impossible to get
[12:29] off of because all of the reservations are booked. So despite its popularity, it apparently went
[12:34] out of business and partially maybe something to do with the cash flow. Now let's talk about the
[12:41] grow part of small meaning businesses' challenges. And the first even starts with capital. A lot of
[12:47] times for these small businesses, they might not be able to get access to loans from banks. So how
[12:53] would they grow? The next is talking about marketing and customer acquisition. So a lot of times for
[12:58] these small businesses, they don't know how to market, what to be marketing. They don't even know
[13:03] who their customers are, who should be their target customers. They have quite of a challenge
[13:08] there. And let's say they do find the right customers. Sales growth is a challenge for them.
[13:13] How do they get their existing customers to buy more, to spend more? And the last big challenge for
[13:18] small meaning businesses is competition. But it's so hard for small meaning businesses to compete
[13:23] with these larger companies already. So think about how much corner bodegas and supermarkets and
[13:30] corner shops had to close down with the entrance of something like Walmart. So we have these eight
[13:35] big challenges, mega challenges that small meaning businesses have shrugged with. Now to move
[13:40] forward to solutioning, we have to figure out which one are we going to prioritize. And our criteria
[13:45] is which of them we think business are most willing to spend on and which of them do we think aligned
[13:51] with Google strength. So I look at these eight things. There are a couple that I would deprioritize
[13:55] because if a business is doing well, these might not be the most important things. For example,
[13:59] business digitization and incorporating technologies might not be so important if there's a ton of
[14:04] demand or things even like tracking business performance or financial management. If a company is
[14:10] doing really well, securing capital and funds to grow might not be as important. So what are the
[14:15] most critical crucial ones that I think businesses will spend on? It's one hiring at the basis of
[14:21] any company will need employees to make it successful. And this is something business time time
[14:27] again have expressed frustration in being able to hire the right people higher in time. And the
[14:33] other two that I think align with Google strengths are the market and customer acquisition component.
[14:38] Of course, Google has already done a fantastic job with this ads platform and helping small
[14:43] meeting businesses show up when people are searching for things. And the other thing that Google
[14:48] grow into is helping these businesses with sales growth. How does it help these customers build
[14:53] relationship with customers to continue growing, then continue understanding what these customers
[14:59] needs are? So because Google has already built its ads platform, I'm also going to deprioritize
[15:04] marketing customer acquisition because Google is already working and succeeding and excelling in
[15:08] this space. So that leads me with hiring and sales growth. And here, as I begin to think about the
[15:14] challenges that I'm prioritizing for Google to build in the next five years, my vision is for Google
[15:20] to make it easier to start and scale businesses. So now let's talk about some solutions. And my
[15:28] pro tip here is you want to think in line of a product suite versus features. Again, they're asking
[15:35] you what could Google build in the next five years. You need to think of something bulky. And here,
[15:40] I also don't want you to over rotate on the most innovative things. So a common mistake people make
[15:46] is throw in trends like, oh, we should build something for chat GBT and not give a specific
[15:52] use case on what it could be useful in solving the user's challenges. So let's talk about a couple
[15:59] solutions that Google could work on for the next five years. So on the hiring angle, there's a
[16:04] couple of dimensions to look at it. The first is challenging the basis that you even need to hire.
[16:11] So maybe what Google can invest in is building robotics that would assist companies in tasks that
[16:19] would make it easier. So the companies don't have to hire as much as needed. Some great examples
[16:25] we're seeing if you've recently been to Unique Low in New York City, they have these self-checkout
[16:31] machines that are pretty amazing. There's no scanning. You literally just put the items in a bag
[16:36] in that section and they detect what you bought. And there's one person coming around to manage all
[16:42] the six stations of self-checkout machines. So that is kind of hardware. You wouldn't necessarily
[16:47] call that a robot, but just imagine a future where Google is building these small robots to take on
[16:52] tasks. For example, for restaurants, you might build robots that can actually do the cooking. I mean,
[16:57] a lot of cooking is following the recipe, which is pretty algorithmic. So think about maybe giving
[17:03] a robot certain ingredients and giving them a list of what to execute on. And the dish should come
[17:09] out pretty consistent each and every time. I mean, even better than if a chef made it. Don't let Gordon
[17:14] Ramsay know that I just said that. Other examples of where robotics could help is you think about
[17:19] in clothing shops. A lot of work is going into doing like folding clothes in the bathroom or in
[17:27] grocery shops. A lot of labor is going into stocking shelves. So could we take some of those tasks
[17:33] and have robots aid people in them so that employers would have to hire less? Of course, I know this
[17:40] topic is very controversial, but I'll leave it there as an idea because I think it is pretty powerful.
[17:45] A second thing I think Google who go into is to build a product suite where they use genitive AI
[17:52] to assist business employees with accomplishing tasks like marketing. For example, when businesses
[17:59] write marketing material, they have to have a person come in to write the copy. So imagine a world
[18:04] where you take an existing employee, any employee who doesn't have expertise in anything,
[18:10] but being armed with this genitive AI, let's say to do marketing, they now don't need to be an expert.
[18:17] But instead, could you leverage that expertise and execute off of it to do more general things?
[18:23] So for example, they can use genitive AI to find the copy they need to write for marketing.
[18:29] And they can do the things that need less expertise like putting that copy on certain types of
[18:36] print or a banner or copying, pasting that copy into an ads platform. So this way it helps small
[18:43] meaning businesses not need to hire for different types of expertise, but have people who are really
[18:49] good at learning, being able to be assisted with expertise to then leave them the easier things to do.
[18:55] A great example I've seen in the spaces, my friend who definitely is not technical,
[19:00] she has not needed to learn how to code to build something. And instead, she's been assisted by
[19:05] ChatGPT to help her come up with code to execute and build this which she basically copied and
[19:11] pasted that code into Python to run things. Well, what could be something for sales growth?
[19:15] Well, one thing for businesses to continue increasing sales from existing customers is to build a
[19:24] relationship with customers. But nowadays, I see so many of these businesses building generic
[19:29] relationships with customers where they're sending generic emails to their customers. That's not
[19:34] really building a relationship. I see a vision of a world where each customer almost has a
[19:39] relationship with a business like they would with a friend. So what could that look like? You can
[19:44] imagine Google may be investing things like business messaging, but already has the Google Math
[19:50] platform where there's a directory of basically all the businesses in the world.
[19:54] So how does it use that to then maybe create a communication channel between the businesses
[19:59] and customers to develop a long-term relationship so that customers can stay loyal and could
[20:07] feedback into the loop to help businesses understand what products they should be building.
[20:12] So this is only one type of product strategy question that companies are asking. Here's another
[20:18] example of a product strategy question being asset large companies like Google. For example,
[20:24] should Amazon enter the smartphone market? So check out this video and I will see you guys in the
[20:29] next video.
