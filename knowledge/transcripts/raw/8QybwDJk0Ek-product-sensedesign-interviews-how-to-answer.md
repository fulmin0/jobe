[00:00] Hey guys, I'm Zyna and I'm a product manager in Silicon Valley and I bring you the best
[00:05] tips and tricks whether you're a current product manager or an inspiring one.
[00:10] Do you have an upcoming product manager interview?
[00:14] If so, you probably will get a product design product sense question.
[00:19] So here are some examples of those.
[00:21] Now if we look at some questions from Google, design a fire alarm for the deaf.
[00:27] We're going to integrate gas station, design alarm clock for blind people.
[00:33] Are you overwhelmed already?
[00:35] If so, stick around and I'm going to share some best practices to help you tackle these
[00:40] type of questions and make you stand out.
[00:43] Some context.
[00:44] You're probably asking and wondering why, why are these outlandish questions asked in
[00:48] the first place from these companies?
[00:51] The product design questions are intentionally ambiguous to see how you navigate towards
[00:56] a strategy and a product.
[00:59] Here are some of the goals of these type of questions.
[01:02] It's to understand how you think, what questions you ask, can you go between conversion and
[01:08] divergent thinking and if you're able to convey a strong rationale behind your decisions?
[01:14] Okay, I'm going to let you in on a secret.
[01:20] There are no right answers to these questions.
[01:24] Many of us as interviewers are not looking for one answer we already have in mind, but
[01:29] there definitely are bad answers.
[01:32] So I'll be talking a little bit about that.
[01:34] Okay, enough talking.
[01:36] Let's show you.
[01:38] First, let's start with a simple structure.
[01:40] I have a four part structure here, the first being the mission and the market landscape.
[01:46] Basically what's already going on in this space and how is it tied to the company's mission?
[01:52] The second is target users.
[01:54] Who should you be building for and prioritizing for?
[01:59] The third is mapping out user journeys and pain points.
[02:03] What are the existing things that suck for these type of users in this experience?
[02:09] And fourth, creative solutions.
[02:12] Let's brainstorm creative solutions on how we can solve these problems for these target
[02:17] users.
[02:19] A question I get all the time, but Diana, won't they know I'm using a framework that everyone
[02:26] else is using?
[02:27] Yes, and that's totally okay.
[02:31] We're not expecting you to come up with a novel framework.
[02:34] We're trying to understand how you use that framework to navigate ambiguity, to have
[02:39] structured thinking, and ultimately be able to back up your decisions with compelling persuasive
[02:45] arguments.
[02:46] Are those that are stressing out, wondering, well, I don't have enough years of product
[02:51] management experience to think like this?
[02:54] Well, I've seen folks from very senior levels even struggle with these type of questions,
[03:00] and I've seen people in college that are able to nail these questions.
[03:04] So don't worry, no matter what level you're at with the right type of practice, you'll
[03:10] be able to get better.
[03:12] So let's go through the five key skills you want to master for product design, product
[03:17] sense questions.
[03:18] The first one is information gathering.
[03:22] You want to bring together the right type of data to help you make your decisions.
[03:27] The second one is structure.
[03:29] You want to organize your thoughts and convey them in a structured way and not a ramble.
[03:35] The third is prioritization.
[03:38] You want to show you're able to focus on the most impactful and key thing.
[03:43] Fourth is user empathy.
[03:45] You want to show that you can internalize your user's pains and frustrations.
[03:51] And the last fifth is brainstorming.
[03:55] Once you've identified some pain points, coming up with creative solutions and how to solve
[03:59] it, that maybe does not exist in the market today.
[04:02] So let's go through these five in more detail, and I'm going to show you how I think through
[04:07] each of these.
[04:08] As we go through these five key skills, we're going to use one of the example questions
[04:12] I showed before.
[04:14] Let's say you're a product manager at a company like Facebook and you're responsible for
[04:20] building a product in the travel category.
[04:23] What would you build?
[04:24] So the first one we mentioned is information gathering.
[04:28] Usually as a product manager, you're getting information from market trends, competitor,
[04:33] analysis, user research, analytics.
[04:37] So that's the key skill that's being tested here and that you have to master.
[04:41] So the ones I like to talk about are opportunity trends in the market, competitor products,
[04:47] and to address the strengths and the mission of the company.
[04:51] Let's see what that looks like in that example question.
[04:55] So let's go down that list, opportunities in the travel space, high level, I'm thinking,
[05:02] researching places you want to go to, second, doing the actual booking of the place you
[05:08] want to go to, third, the transportation to get there, flights, buses, cars, the fourth
[05:16] is booking the accommodation where you're going to stay, and then five is finding the local
[05:20] experiences that you're going to participate in once you're there.
[05:25] Some trends I'm seeing in the travel space that could serve as inspiration for me.
[05:31] Creating transportation, getting accommodation.
[05:35] Nowadays are a bit commoditized.
[05:37] For example, you have some competitors in that space already, such as bookings.com, for
[05:46] transportation, all the airlines are established players, Airbnb for hotels.
[05:53] So all of that infrastructure exists and it is good enough.
[05:57] Another trend I'm seeing is people really like to participate in local experiences,
[06:04] ones that are unique and not just the traditional tourist experiences.
[06:09] And lastly, I'm thinking about the mission and the strengths of the company.
[06:13] So since this is a Facebook question, Facebook's mission is to one, bring people together
[06:17] and build community.
[06:19] Some of the strengths of the company that can relate to travel are one.
[06:23] There's a lot of social sharing going on the platform related to two.
[06:28] There's a lot of user generated content such as photographs and reviews, especially when
[06:32] people are traveling.
[06:34] The third discovery on the platform to take away here is to think about information you
[06:41] might already have and gather that to then inspire a point of view.
[06:47] So let's move on to the second key skill, which is conveying in a structured and organized
[06:53] approach.
[06:54] To convey structured thinking, you want to be able to think of the top categories and
[07:00] then further funnel down to think of sub categories under that.
[07:06] So in the example of travel I have here, a bad example would be saying things like budget
[07:12] travelers, them business travelers and teens, because all those can overlap.
[07:18] Instead, structured thinking is when you're able to come up with maybe mutually exclusive
[07:23] buckets.
[07:24] So an example here is we break down target users in leisure and business.
[07:33] Then I further break down leisure into explorers, tourists and resortists.
[07:40] And those groups are different enough where there's not too much overlap.
[07:46] So something like this would be a good enough segmentation of target users to start off
[07:51] with.
[07:52] Let's move on to the third skill.
[07:54] The third skill is prioritization.
[07:58] As a product manager, your concy overwhelmed by a ton of information.
[08:02] So your job is to help the team prioritize and focus.
[08:07] For prioritization, ideally you start with a criteria that you're optimizing for.
[08:13] I usually like to choose two to three criteria to evaluate my choices.
[08:19] So in the last case, we showed target users.
[08:22] I might use the criteria size of the population and which of these populations are underserved.
[08:29] And maybe a third one is the frequency of use.
[08:33] So then help me objectively figure out which of these user segments I might focus on.
[08:40] And this is key because we talked earlier that the product design, product sense question
[08:45] is meant to test and understand how you come to certain decisions to show that you're
[08:50] not biased.
[08:52] One of the common mistakes I see is people come in and they choose one without any rationale
[08:59] of why they made that choice and use it against your options and measure low medium high.
[09:06] And a bit of your thinking why you're saying low medium high to each of them and that
[09:10] really helps to interview or understand your thinking.
[09:14] The fourth skill you want to display in product sense product design questions is user empathy.
[09:22] We're always trying to hire for product managers that can empathize with their users pain
[09:27] points because those are the people that are best able to design solutions for them.
[09:34] To hear a key skill you want to nail down is to be able to map the user journey at every
[09:40] point of the experience and then identify in each of these themes what are the things
[09:47] that sucked.
[09:50] You want to show you're able to really talk to the granular difficulties of the user's
[09:55] experience and feel the frustration or annoyance they feel when they're experiencing these
[10:01] pain points.
[10:03] Let's go back to our travel example and create a user journey and identify some pain points.
[10:08] First part is getting inspiration on where to go for your next trip.
[10:13] Our sources of inspiration are seeing photos from friends, places I've always wanted to
[10:16] go.
[10:17] So I wouldn't say this pain point here is super high.
[10:20] Second is doing the research to figure out where I want to go when I'm at the place.
[10:25] And this can take hours I'm asking my friends checking a trip advisor googling and it can
[10:31] be very tedious so this could be a source of a huge pain point.
[10:35] A third part of the journey could be deciding between places.
[10:39] If I have five places in mind how do I land on going to one?
[10:43] I only have a week but this is also a source of frustration, the indecision or analysis
[10:48] paralysis, the more places I look.
[10:51] If first part of the journey could be aligning with their friends and family members who
[10:56] are usually traveling with, which can be so tedious and painful because everyone has
[11:01] different preferences so this could be a source of a huge pain point as well.
[11:06] The fifth part could be creating itinerary, which is like fitting puzzle pieces together
[11:12] because you have so much information and coming from all the different people you're traveling
[11:16] with.
[11:17] This itself could also be extremely frustrating.
[11:22] We just talked through some parts of the user journey and you see how I showed emotion
[11:29] on which parts of the journey could be frustrating for users.
[11:33] That's what you want to do.
[11:34] Show that you can put yourself in their shoes and feel what sucks.
[11:41] The fifth and last key skill I would say you need to nail is being able to brainstorm
[11:48] creatively.
[11:49] And I've seen that the more granular you can come up with the pain points, the more
[11:55] unique your solutions naturally end up becoming.
[11:59] For example, if my pain point is too high level, an example being needing to do research
[12:07] before traveling is a pain point, some solutions I came up with were kind of generic.
[12:15] The first one, search with filters, second one, asking your friends on places to go and
[12:19] third trending places.
[12:21] But when I narrowed that solution to be more concrete, here, needing details on local
[12:27] places to visit, I was able to come up with a much more unique set of solutions.
[12:34] The first one I thought of was, well, why don't we create a board, kind of like a Pinterest
[12:39] where I get all my friends who have gone to these other places that I'm interested in
[12:43] going into and contributing their photos, their suggestions, so that I'm not just asking
[12:48] one friend, but asking a bunch of friends.
[12:51] The second solution was to allow people to publish their existing travel inter, their
[12:58] previous travel itineraries and as, as like a crowdsourced way to share with other people,
[13:05] even if you don't know them and allow the company to make that searchable.
[13:11] The last one, why don't we involve local guides who are doing this professionally and
[13:18] put their listings on a platform so that if I was going to a country, being able to reach
[13:25] out to them for advice.
[13:26] The takeaway is basically, having more granular pain points can inspire more unique solutions.
[13:36] So those are the five key skills that you want to master for product design questions
[13:42] and I've showed you some examples of how I think through it.
[13:45] You know how in sports you drill to get better?
[13:48] I also recommend here the drill each of these five skills to optimize how you perform
[13:55] in each skill and then bring it together.
