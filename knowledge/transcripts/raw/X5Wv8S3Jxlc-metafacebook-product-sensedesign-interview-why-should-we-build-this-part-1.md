[00:00] If you're interviewing for a product manager role at a top pet company, you're most likely going to get a product manager interview question like
[00:09] Design a product for fill in the blank
[00:13] Finding doctors, travelers, hobbyists, anything
[00:18] Most candidates rush through one of the most important parts of the question
[00:24] And fail to show strategic thinking, which is addressing why should we even build this product?
[00:31] So here's my simple structure top tips and examples to help you tackle the first part of the product sense interview
[00:41] Hey guys, I'm Diana and I'm a senior product manager at a big pet company in Silicon Valley, California
[00:49] And I bring you the best tips to get into product management and teach you how to succeed once you've made it
[00:56] So again, we're going to tackle the first part of the product sense question, which is answering why the heck should we even build this?
[01:05] So my structure here is one, start with trends
[01:10] Is the space being asked about part of a growing trend?
[01:14] And who are some existing players in the Zico system now?
[01:18] Two, talk about opportunities, why is building for this important or aligned with the company's mission?
[01:26] And number three, talk about strengths and weaknesses.
[01:30] Does this company have strengths or weaknesses that either play well or don't to the space?
[01:37] So let's dive into an example and I'll give you more tips along the way.
[01:42] The question we're going to use today is design a product to help people find doctors.
[01:48] So let's jump into the first step, which is talking about trends.
[01:52] So my tip here is a share broad trends happening in the space so that you can show that you can think big picture.
[02:01] If you can share any insights or data and stats even better, if not just talk about the trend generally.
[02:09] So why does this matter?
[02:12] Because companies want to hire product leaders who are well rounded with knowledge on various topics and can talk intelligently about various topics, especially technologies.
[02:24] So I'll give you an example here related to this question.
[02:27] So the trend that we're seeing is healthcare being digitized and data being used more often to help consumers looking for healthcare make the right decisions.
[02:38] From companies using AI to detect cancer than illnesses to consumer focused companies like Zachdok, which gives people's ratings and reviews and more information about doctors to help them choose doctors.
[02:54] A common mistake that people will make here is neglecting the existing players in the ecosystem.
[03:02] And I see candidates fall into this trap all the time where they pick pain points that are already being solved for by another player and they end up brainstorming solutions that already exist.
[03:14] Another common mistake in this section is giving off the impression that you're already solutioning.
[03:20] Think of trends but don't give off the impression that you're already coming up with solutions that you're stuck with.
[03:26] Guys, have you learned something so far?
[03:29] If so, let us know by liking the video.
[03:32] And I'm going to be coming with new videos next week to help you ace the product manager interview.
[03:38] So make sure to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss the next video.
[03:43] Now let's go into the second section, which is identifying opportunities.
[03:49] So my tip here is to explain why building for the space is important.
[03:54] And if the interviewer explicitly told you that they want you to build this product for the company you're interviewing for,
[04:02] also talk about how the space aligns with their mission.
[04:06] Does Sharon example for the question we're talking about?
[04:09] Everyone needs to visit a doctor whether it's once a year or every day for those with chronic illnesses.
[04:16] And hence finding a doctor is so important to everyone's well-being over the long term.
[04:23] And it could be important to our company because A, there's a huge total addressable market we're talking about here.
[04:31] Because everyone needs doctors. B, healthcare is a costly service.
[04:36] Which means there's a huge revenue potential here for us.
[04:40] And C, we have the opportunity to improve healthcare overall.
[04:45] If we're able to increase the transparency of doctors and their services to help people make better decisions on which doctors they go with,
[04:54] a common mistake people will make here is they assume that they should be building for the company that they're interviewing for.
[05:01] Never assume here. Always ask.
[05:04] Now the third part of the structure is addressing strengths and weaknesses.
[05:09] So my tip here, if the interviewer explicitly stated that they want you to build for the company that you're interviewing for,
[05:17] ask yourself, what are some of the companies' strengths that are going to help them win in this space?
[05:23] And what are some weaknesses that will keep them from being competitive in this space?
[05:29] So the example, if we're going to use a company like Facebook, some strengths that they have in being able to compete in this ecosystem is A.
[05:38] They already have a ton of the doctors and the organizations like hospitals that they're a part of on the Facebook platform, either as pages, as people.
[05:48] So it might not be a significant lift to organize data to help consumers make better decisions.
[05:54] B, we have a large user base.
[05:59] And we could use that to crowdsource information about doctors faster.
[06:04] And C, given our powerful AI technology, we may be able to personalize the experience of finding doctors better for people if we had health data.
[06:14] Now what are some weaknesses standing in the way of Facebook being able to succeed in helping people find doctors?
[06:20] A, is not having existing health data on the platform.
[06:25] And B, because health data is sensitive, people don't really trust any random platform to have and hold.
[06:33] A user's health data. So these things might make it very hard for Facebook to collect the data it needs to personalize and experience to help people make better decisions.
[06:43] So let's summarize, you want to spend the first five minutes of your product sends interview questions answering why should we build this?
[06:52] And the framework that we use today was one, talking about trends in the ecosystem.
[06:57] Two, what is the opportunity at stake here? And three, what are some of the strengths and weaknesses that are going to help or stand in the way of the company being able to compete in this space?
[07:08] So this video is one part of a series of videos where I break down each of the sections of the product sense question and give you key tips to help you stand out and face the product sense interview.
[07:22] So check out these other videos that go through different sections of the product sense interview. Thanks guys.
